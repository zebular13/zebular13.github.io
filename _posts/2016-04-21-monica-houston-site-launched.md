I'm infinitely curious, unfortunately, so over the years I've changed my blog from a simple HTML site to a more complex one powered by jquery, to a Wordpress site, to a Squarespace site, and now to this cute blog, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The best thing is that all I need for blogging now is a text editor and I have complete control.
