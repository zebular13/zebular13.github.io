Imagine you lived in a world where muggings happened every day and nobody did anything about it.
Well, it was mostly just women mugging men. Often, women would hold men at knife point and take their wallets. Frequently men would get stabbed. But if you were lucky enough to survive a stabbing AND arrest your mugger, there was little hope for you in court. In fact, YOUR actions would be scrutinized. What did you do to bring this mugging upon yourself?

So why did people let this happen? Men didn’t feel safe anywhere, even with their partners. In fact, often it was their partners that mugged them.
The thing is, the women weren’t using knives like you and I think of knives. Ok, this is an alternate reality where women actually have long, knifelike claws that come out of their fingers. Just think of Wolverine.

If you were a male, your first mugging might occur sometime in high school or college. Your dad is always warning you to be safe. Don’t wear flashy suits or women will think you’re rich. Your mom warns you too. She knows how women think. She advises you not to date, since she knows that all women think about are money and they’ll knife you and steel your wallet if you make a wrong move. You wonder if she’s ever knifed anyone. Thankfully she never knifes you, although you know some boys your age whose mothers knifed them when they were young. One shared this with you in secret and made you promise not to tell anyone. Another told the authorities and they took his mother away. Now he’s in therapy because he feels guilty about doing that to his mother.

At night when you walk you get nervous when you see a woman pass. Is she going to knife you and take your wallet? You breathe a sigh of relief as she continues down the sidewalk.

You’ve read that women basically can’t control themselves. They evolved to knife men in ancient times and steal the wild boar or bison they were dragging back to the cave. It’s basically an evolutionary tactic so they can provide for their young. It’s hardwired.

Most of the girls you date of course are perfectly nice. Women have evolved past that. But you always worry that one night you’ll be alone with one and you’ll get mugged. One night it happens. You’re at a sorority party and you’re a bit tipsy. A woman asks if you’d like to check out her room. You’re excited, since you know only the best looking boys get picked up by the sisters in this sorority. You follow her eagerly and go sit on her bed. You’re attracted to her. She’s leaning in for a kiss. Suddenly she whips her claw out and points it at your neck. “Give me your wallet.” She says.

You’re shocked and terrified and you do as your told. You know that when a woman’s claws are out it’s impossible to overpower her and it’s likely you’ll get hurt. You’re drunk and dizzy and don’t know what to do. She takes your wallet and afterwards she lets you go. You awkwardly make your way home as day breaks. You’re ashamed to tell your friends. At least she didn’t stab you. You’re grateful for that. You could have died. Now you’re $100 short on cash and you have to get a new drivers license and student id, but at least she didn’t stab you. You justify it in your mind. I mean, you were drunk after all. Basically the perfect target. And you agreed to go up to her room. It’s absolutely your fault. You resolve to wear less expensive suits in the future when you go to sorority parties.

You’re afraid of girls for several month after that. Sometimes when you have sex you start to panic and can’t finish. You’re dating a girl and she’s kind and sweet, but you’re always nervous that she’s going to stab you, so you tell her some lie about how you need to focus on your studies and you stop seeing her.

One night you’re out jogging on the college golf courses. It’s a full moon and the golf courses are brightly lit, but you know maybe this isn’t the best idea. You imagine your dad’s voice in your head. “Son, you shouldn’t be wearing such nice sneakers. You know a woman might mug you.” Still, you go anyway because you need to get your run in and you were too busy studying all day.

Then it happens. A woman steps out from the bushes with her claw extended. You scream and run in the opposite direction. Thankfully she doesn’t bother to chase you, but after that you stop running outside and you avoid the golf course, even in the day.

When you go out, you make sure to always go out with a pack of your guy friends. It’s safer that way. You wait for them as they iron their suits. See, it’s dangerous to wear nice suits, but it’s also expected. Women won’t pay attention to men who don’t wear nice suits and you definitely won’t get moved to the front of the line at the club.

You manage to graduate college without another mugging incident, unlike most of your friends. It seems that almost every day there’s another report in the campus paper about a man getting mugged. You and your friends sometimes talk about it. What was the man wearing, you wonder. And why was he outside on his own so late?

Many of your friends have lost thousands of dollars in muggings. It’s just something that happens. Women evolved to do this. It’s part of life. You all vow to be safer in the future.

You’re working at your first job and you’ve been carrying on a friendly flirtation with one of your coworkers. She’s pretty and smart and has an Ivy League degree. You’re sure that she’s too evolved to knife someone and steal their wallet. She invites you to the holiday party and you go with her. You both drink too much wine and go back to her place. It’s a gorgeous house by the river and you can see the christmas lights reflected up at you when you stand on the balcony. You think you’re falling in love. You carry her into the bedroom and pin her down. Suddenly her claws come out. You scream, startled. She stabs you in the gut as you scream. Blood is everywhere. “No!” You yell. But it’s too late. She fishes your wallet and your phone from your pants with a smirk. “Want me to call 911?” She taunts. You’re writhing in pain, you’re dying. “Yes, please call them.” 
Instead she drives you to the hospital, where she smiles flirtatiously at the nurse who is committing patients.

“What happened?” Asks the nurse. 
“Oh, we were just playing,” says your coworker. “Accidents happen.”
You’re writhing on the floor, blood gushing from your wound. Can’t the nurse see that none of this is true? Can’t he catch your eye and let you know he doesn’t believe her. You’re in too much pain and shock to contradict her, as you’re wheeled into the operating room and a doctor anesthetizes you and sews you up. The next morning your coworker is still there. “See, I waited all night for you,” she says, as if she hadn’t done anything wrong.

“You knifed me!” You practically scream.
“You wanted it,” She says.
“No, I definitely didn’t want it!” You can’t believe she’s still here, in this room, after what she did to you. When she leaves you call your dad to tell him what happened. You can feel the disbelief in his voice too. “Well, we can get a lawyer, I guess.”

You’re going to take this to court. Your guy friends cheer you on. You’re the brave one. You’re taking on the system today. You’re taking on mugging culture. The lawyer is a cute blonde woman. She questions you in the office.
“How many times did you have sex with your coworker? You’re sure it wasn’t an accident?”
“An accident? She stole my wallet! She still has it!”
“You’re sure you didn’t give it to her? This is going to be hard to prove.”
“I have a fucking knife wound.”
“I know, but a lot of guys like to play rough.”

The judge gives you the same line of questioning. You blush as she grills you with personal questions. You try not to look at your parents who are also in the courtroom as she asks you about your debts, about what you like to wear, about what you were wearing that night. Your coworker has hired an expensive team of lawyers and they grill you even harder. They pull your public pictures from Facebook, and even some private ones you didn’t even know they had access to. They point to how you like to dress in expensive suits. It’s possible you actually enjoy a bit of mugging role-play. Isn’t that right? Maybe you even enjoy being stabbed a little. Don’t you?

You question yourself. Maybe it was consensual. Maybe I did agree to be stabbed. Your coworker has an Ivy League degree after all. And did I mention that she was on the lacrosse team? She would never do anything without your consent. Your lawyers looks at you. Was it consensual? She asks you on your next lunch break. “No, of course not.” 
But the trial isn’t going well. More evidence is brought against you. Her lawyers cross examine you about your drug use. Is it true you like to smoke a bit of marijuana now and then?
Objection your honor. What does that have to do with the case. 
The verdict comes in. Not guilty. You pay your lawyer. You look for a new place of employment. You avoid your parents an friends. You sink into a pool of depression and stop dating women completely.

The next time this happens, you know, you’ll be branded as the man with a history of accusing women of mugging you.
