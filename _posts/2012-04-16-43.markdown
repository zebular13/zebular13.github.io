I'm still on Posterous, and you can still find my writings and translations (and my bicycle trip) atÂ [http://monicahouston.posterous.com](http://monicahouston.posterous.com/). I've decided to make my own blog - mostly because I am a control freak and partly because it's just safer to have my content on my own site if Twitter ever decides to get rid of Posterous (not to be alarmist - I don't really see that happening soon).
