So I finally got around to scheduling a date with my all time favorite person. On my google calendar in a lightÂ lavender box, from 10pm - 12:30am, I have "Date with Monica" written in. It's been a while since I've been planning this, and I keep flaking out, but I've finally written it in my calendar, and my calendar is what dictates my fate. I'll probably read some books. Maybe I'll write a blog post or an email or two. I might even eat something, or do some yoga. I'm extremely excited, and a little worried that I might flake out again...but I won't.
