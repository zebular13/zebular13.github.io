      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 5</title>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117904">
Before you do anything, you have to decide to do it. A decision is not a static thing. You have many opportunities to decide whether you want to keep doing that thing or not. In fact, you have infinite opportunities, because at any one of the infinite moments in time you can decide to keep doing that thing, or stop doing that thing. Often, between the beginning of a task and the end of a task I will forget why I wanted to do that task in the first place. Or perhaps a more interesting task comes along and I choose to do that task instead of finishing the first task.&nbsp;Or perhaps I have bad luck and it seems like the task isn’t worth the effort it’s taking.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117907">On Thursday night, I decided that I would get to Florence, Oregon before 10pm. I decided that again on Friday morning. I had no idea about how I would do it. I didn’t have a nutrition plan, or a goal pace, or an odometer. That didn’t matter, because I had decided that I would do it.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117910">I set out in the cold morning. The nearly full moon lingered in the sky. I reached Oregon City by 7am without even one incident of snakebite or cholera. Every 10 miles or so I checked my phones maps to make sure I was still on the correct route. Today I was not going to fuck around with directions. Mists hung over the vineyards on the Oregon Countryside. I was going the right direction, so I was able to return to my thoughts.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117916">Everything we do in life starts with some sort of decision. You decide to keep doing something, or you decide to stop doing something, or you decide to do something else. Sometimes, if you have a bigger long-term goal, not reaching a short term goal makes sense. For instance, I wanted to get through Salem by 10am, but I stopped for a sandwich and a donut at a café and I ended up helping an old lady with her new ipad and writing a blog post for an hour and a half. If I hadn’t done these things I might not have had the morale or the stamina to continue.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117921">Some people are very good at making the same decisions over and over. We praise these people as “determined.” These are the people who make their ideas come to life because they act and then they follow through.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117924">This is a macabre example, but the Donner party was determined. At least some of them were. They had decided that they were going to get to California, so they kept going, despite how late it was in the fall. And once they were trapped, they resorted to cannibalism because they were determined to survive. Oftentimes, unforeseen circumstances, or bad luck, can reverse our decisions. Often, we have conscious or unconscious lines that we will not cross in our determination. I had decided that I would get to Florence, but one of my unconscious boundaries was that I would not continue if I had to eat humans. Don’t worry, this is not a story of cannibalism in that sense.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117929">I think that the people who we praise as “determined” can sometimes also be the people who have the loosest boundaries for what they will do to succeed. They may not realize it when they dream their dream, but when something gets in the way of their dream – when they have to fire a good employee because they can hire someone else at a lower wage, when they have to use ingredients that aren’t ethically sourced, or when they have to have to make shoddier gadgets because their shareholders want higher margins – they don’t think twice about it. They have their goal, and they are going to reach it no matter what. Whenever any of us goes after our dreams, we are faced with this type of decision. Often, the people who succeed at making their dreams come true are psychopaths. They don’t mind throwing someone under the train for the sake of their dreams. And the kind-hearted people? They are just dreamers. They don’t believe in breaking eggs, so they don’t make omelettes.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117934">In today’s world, we are obsessed with speed. When we are trying to do something, and someone else does it faster, it can be discouraging. Business people talk about the advantages of being “first-to-market.” If you only care about where you are going and not how you get there, you can cut corners and get there faster. But that is the difference between a power boat trip and a cruise on a sailboat. How you get somewhere still does matter. Otherwise, I would have <em>flown </em>to San Francisco.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117942">I’d like to believe that the world is still a place where kind people can achieve their dreams and be recognized by others as being achievers. I’d like to think that people who keep their determination in an ethical check and cooperate with others to reach their goals will be more respected than the highly competitive self-promoters.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117948">I did achieve my goal that day, and I don’t think I hurt anyone except for a few hapless flies who flew into my open mouth. The roads were smooth and flat, and the wind was at my back. It was a cyclists’ dream. The last stretch was along the Eugene-Florence Highway. There is nothing along that road, not even a gas station. Finally, 33 miles from Florence, I found a farm that sold pastries and old-fashioned sodas. I drank a Mountain Dew and ate a muffin. The grandmother who sold them to me was concerned that I would be riding in the dark. So I took off again, trying to beat the sunset by riding towards it. I was surrounded by tall pine trees, and the air smelled wild. Giant RVs pulling trailers filled with dirt bikes drove past me. Although I cursed myself to ride faster, there was nothing I could do to keep the sun from setting. It sank behind the trees, and I was surrounded by dark and occasional car headlights. Thankfully, the margin of the road had grown so that I had my own lane to ride in. The only time it disappeared was when I had to go through a tunnel. Knowing that this might be the last thing I ever did, I pushed the bike signal on the tunnel and rode in. The worst thing about being hit by a car in a tunnel would be the fact that I wouldn’t see it coming. I hate the idea of not being able to face my death.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_117953">I didn’t die (obviously). I made it through the tunnel, and then I followed the dark, forest road for another 20 miles. The air smelled wild, like pine trees and salt. The darkness was total, and except for the sound of frogs, it was silent. At last I reached the welcoming lights of Florence. I sat at a gas station and called Matt, my couchsurf host, to let him know I was there. I think I may have been delirious. I had done it. I had ridden 176 miles in one day by myself carrying all my own gear. Matt offered to come pick me up. I think he noted the tone of delirium in my voice. He offered me my own room, a bowl of lo mein and a hot shower. I am eternally grateful.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Micro Controller Library</title>
      <link>/writing/231</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh man, I’m getting excited just writing about this. So, last week I got a grant from the Awesome Foundation to make a Micro Controller Library and it’s finally coming together.
What the hell is a Micro Controller Library? It’s basically a giant package of awesome that turns ordinary people into gods of technology.</p>
<p>Library might be a misleading term, since there aren’t any books involved (although I’m currently trying to figure out licensing so that I can make some ebooks about physical computing available to you on your computer or kindle). What makes it a library is that it’s free (except for a $5 startup fee when we process you into the member database) and you can check electronics out and bring them home for up to two weeks. It’s based on the West Seattle Tool Library’s make-your-own tool library kit. Local Tools even got me set up with an <a title="inventory site" href="http://microelectronicslibrary.localtools.org/library/" target="_blank">inventory site</a> so I can track tools and members and you can see what’s available for checkout and reserve items. The library will have a home in the Maker Space Jigsaw Renaissance located at 821 Seattle Boulevard South.</p>
<p>So far I’ve ordered eight Arduino Unos, a pair of Arduino Megas, and a Raspberry Pi. I’ve also ordered 6 different starter kits, which come with a ton of different sensors, power sources, breadboards, jumper cables, and various shields to connect different components to.</p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to build an autonomous wheeled robot? I ordered a chassis and sensors so you can build one using a micro controller. And if you want your autonomous wheeled robot to take photos and upload them to you Facebook, I’ve also ordered a couple of Wi-Fi shields. Do you want to prototype a self-watering plant? There’s a soil moisture sensor that plugs directly into an Arduino.</p>
<p>You can even make your own interactive, digital games using buttons, LED screens and joysticks that plug into a breadboard.</p>
<p>So how do you become a library member? You don’t have to wait until the library is set up. Stop by Jigsaw Renaissance or the Seattle Arduino Meetup at The Easy next week. Bring an ID and $5 (or $10 if you want to help sponsor membership for a low income geek. Technology access for everyone!) Be prepared to spend about 20 minutes since you’ll have to read a short article about safety and not blowing things up and whatnot. Then I add your name to the database and you’re a member!</p>
<p>If you have any electronics sitting around that might make a good addition to the library, please let me know! Also, donations of money and time are more than welcome. As the packages start coming in I’m going to need people to help with sorting, labeling and inventorying parts. Plus, you’ll get to be first to play with all the new electronics!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>"Networking"</title>
      <link>/writing/101</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After work on Friday I had to taper immediately into the weekend. As we know this is always a difficult task if you haven't been practicing. Luckily, I had been practicing since Thursday and was quite warmed up. Still, it was challenging, especially since I was overbooked.Drew, my awesome coworker and neighbor, drove me back to my apartment, where I debated taking a taxi and taking the bus across town to <a href="http://www.cycseattle.org/">The Corinthian Yacht Club</a>. See, I have already made yacht club friends. I didn’t even need to read a boating book in conspicuous places, or jump out at unsuspecting customers in a boat store. All it took was a bit of networking. And by networking, I mean rock climbing (I love the word “networking” because it can mean anything. In fact, I spent most of this weekend networking). Our guide, Mountain Man Matt, had friends from work who had lived on a boat since 1996. He connected us, and I spoke to his friend Marge on the phone. She invited me to the Yacht Club’s Membership Drive.  “I’ll be there. What do you look like, so I know who to look for?” She asked.
“I’m about average height, short brown hair. And really really ridiculously good-looking.”
I spent the half hour after getting home from work stressing about how I was going to get to the Yacht Club by 7pm and then to downtown Seattle by 9pm and still have time to get changed for the Bonza Bash. I ran around getting absolutely nothing done and finally decided to just throw my dress in a bag and call a cab. I still don’t have my address memorized. The company called me to tell me that the first cabby had ended up in Ballard because I had given him the wrong directions. So I tried again, and this time the cab showed up and whisked me over to Shilshole Marina where the Corinthians have their club.</p>
<p>I was a little nervous walking in, especially since I was still dressed in my work clothes and carrying a big bag containing my formal dress and shoes for Bonza Bash. The first thing I did in the club was get a glass of wine, since that’s what everyone else seemed to be doing. I tipped the bartender a dollar, and he handed me my tip back. Then I realized that he wasn’t a bartender. He was a club member who was volunteering as a bartender. Oops.</p>
<p>Of course Marge recognized me immediately from my description. She introduced me to some very helpful sailors, including Al and Lou, who are an encyclopedia of boating information, and Bruce, who is teaching Rookie Rally, the boat racing course that starts in two weeks. I signed up and will be learning to race boats starting Monday, May 7th. Don’t worry. When I am a member of the Yacht Club I will still talk to my friends.</p>
<p>The Corinthian Yacht Club is primarily a racing club, but there were several people who had lived aboard. They were fun, friendly and helpful. In fact, they were so helpful that I accidentally stayed and talked until 9pm. Thankfully, a couple of sailors dropped me off downtown, where I put my dress and shoes on in five minutes in my friends' bathroom, left my street clothes at my friends’ house, and rushed over to <a href="http://bonzabash.com/">Bonza Bash</a>, the most formal party in the tallest building in Seattle.</p>
<p>I had planned to meet some other Seattle people in the Polar Bar, but when I walked in, the place was empty and a bartender told me that they had just left. I asked the bartender how to get to Colombia Tower. “It’s one block up the street. Also, it’s the tallest building in Seattle so you can’t really miss it.”</p>
<p>I have to say, the view from the Colombia Tower bathrooms is amazing. Each stall has a spectacular picture window. Helicopters flying by must also get a great view inside.</p>
<p>Seattle’s Social Whore was there, wearing a classy hat and chilling with a group of beautiful ladies. Except that according to this video I must now call him “<a href="http://vimeo.com/41219380">Seattle's Social Light</a>.”
Also, for your viewing pleasure, <a href="http://vimeo.com/41220021">here I am</a>. Ok, that’s enough of that.</p>
<p>Don't worry. Even though I am famous I will still talk to you. And you can follow me on twitter @houston_monica. Alright, that's enough networking for the weekend.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Blistering Barnacles</title>
      <link>/writing/106</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a wild weekend (you can see the exhaustion in my eyes in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77777422@N03/6980292118/in/set-72157629929042767">photo</a> taken Saturday night), a Sunday run with Club Northwest and Dim Sum for Sunday brunch with friends, I set off to Orcas Island to search for a boat. If you ever go to Orcas Island, or any island really, make sure that you check the ferry schedule beforehand. By blind luck I made the 3:30pm ferry, otherwise I would have been stuck waiting for two hours and missed getting to see the boat I was going there to look at. Also, if you’re going to Orcas Island, leave your car on shore. After we got there we discovered that they have mopeds for rent right on the ferry dock.
At the marina, the boat seller, a sailory looking man with a white beard and a red nose, launched into a description of the engine before we had even gotten to the dock. I was there with Stark, and even though I was asking the questions, the owner assumed that Stark was the one buying the boat since he’s a dude and he directed a steady stream of boat-speak at him. After several minutes of this, Stark said, “Actually, she’s the one that’s buying the boat, so you should talk to her.” The boat owner grunted and continued to address Stark as I took notes in my tiny moleskine. Or rather, I pretended to take notes (I was actually just scribbling random words that the seller was saying as well as a few doodles).</p>
<p>I was a little nervous because I wasn’t sure what to call the parts of the boat I was looking at. I tried to look knowledgeable and skeptical, so I asked about the “beam” and the “draft” as well as the fuel-line, but that pretty much exhausted my boat vocab, so I just shut up and poked my head around the boat. It probably wasn’t necessary for me to feign knowledge however, as the beers he had been drinking had made the owner honest. “It needs about $5,000 worth of work,” he admitted, pointing out the leaky chainplates and rotten wood on the cabin.</p>
<p>Far from discouraging me, the trip made me excited to learn more about boating. I imagined the gentle rocking of the boat underfoot becoming part of my daily life. Waking up on the water, sailing the boat into the sunset, learning how to wire my own outlets with waterproof cables, the constant smell of diesel and wd-40, having to use the bathrooms at the gym when the head stops working, not being able to cook because I can’t get the alcohol burners to work on the stove, freezing in the winter because the propane stove breaks down, dying of carbon monoxide poisoning because the cabin is isn’t properly ventilated - ah, it’s the sailor’s life for me! Seriously, it sounds amazing!</p>
<p>Besides all of these perks, sailing has by far the richest vocabulary of any sport.
I just took checked the book “Sailing for Dummies” out of the library. I’m going sailing tomorrow night, so I have to read up on my sailing terminologies so that I sound like an expert. Here is an actual phrase from the book:
“If the boat is not equipped with jiffy lines, begin with the luff cringle. Secure it to the boom by catching the grommet on a hook on the boom or by inserting a reefing hook into the grommet and tying it to the boom near the gooseneck. You can also tie the cringle to a cleat on the mast. This creates a new tack. Tighten the halyard to secure it.”
And here is an actual phrase that I can say as a sailor:
“Secure the luff cringle to the boom grommet! Avast ye scurvy seadogs!”</p>
<p>Luff cringle, luff cringle, luff cringle! I could say that all day long! I’m surprised that more people don’t become sailors based on the vocabulary alone. I can’t wait to start my sailboat racing course next week so that I can say these words to people who will know what they mean (as opposed to spouting them off to random passing strangers.)

      <title>Sounders vs Galaxy</title>
      <link>/writing/109</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm not going to lie - I went to see Seattle Sounders vs LA Galaxy Wednesday night with the hope of seeing David Beckham. Unfortunately, he was injured and didn't even bother to show up. Fortunately, the Sounders won.
I learned most of my Spanish <em>palabrotas</em> by going to futból games. The Sounders game was my first US pro soccer game and I had to learn a whole new set of chants.</p>
<p>First of all, there was the original "Soouuuunnndderrrrss!" shouted in chorus from one side of the stadium to the other. Then there was the creative chant "FIGHT....and WIN!" The people behind us made up their own original chant: "We're better than you!"</p>
<p>We weren't in the crazies section, so we missed a lot of good chants that I probably shouldn't repeat here anyway.</p>
<p>I realized halfway through that the Sounder's Game that the Sounders were my team. I was screaming at them to "step on the ball!" or "kick it in!"  or "Just kick it in, #@% it!" We only won by two. Apparently if we had won by three goals, everybody could have gotten a free haircut, so I had a lot of incentive to encourage the Sounders to win. As it was, since we won we still got free appetizers at Hard Rock Café. We also got glowsticks, and I accidentally cracked mine and got glowstick oil all over myself. I smeared it onto my jeans and my face on the way to the Hard Rock Café. Unfortunately when we walked in they told us that they were closing early. I complemented the waiter on his flair and showed him my glowing jeans, but he wasn't impressed and shoed us out. We ended up in The Alibi Room, Pike Place's worst kept secret bar. Their vegan pizza is scrumptious.</p>
<p>I don't know how it happened. I've been here for three weeks and I'm already saying "we" when I talk about the Sounders. I must already consider myself to be a Seattleite.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Sailing and Ukuleles</title>
      <link>/writing/112</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5889313465449959"></strong>I never realize the connection between sailboats and ukuleles until last night, sitting on a sailboat in Des Moines, WA. The rain was pouring down in sheets, so what would have been my first ever sailboat race was cancelled, but sitting inside a cozy boat listening to a ukulele concert drinking Californian beer and learning how to tie a bowline knot was not too much of a disappointment. Our hostess, Joan Marie, decided that we should invite the next door neighbors over also, so we walked across the dock and knocked on the side of their 40 foot boat - "The Filthy Whore" (yes, the name was painted on the stern). Two large sailors appeared carrying tiny ukuleles and more beer.  They argued for a bit about which one had the honor of being the namesake of their boat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Joe, the male half of the duo, was wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and flip flops despite the cold. He pointed to the boat in the slip across from him, a 42 foot cruiser whose windmill was spinning and turning in the wind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The owner has a hot tub inside his boat," said Joe. "If you ever run into him, he'll ask you to come in his hot tub. Whatever you do, don't do it."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Joe seemed to know what he was talking about, so I agreed that I wouldn't go in the neighbor's hot tub. Instead, we went back in the beautiful red 28 foot Islander that I was checking out. That's when the ukulele concert happened. Joan Marie had learned to play when her grandmother, who had also lived aboard, was sick. She said her grandmother had loved it when she played the ukulele. She played Iz's rendition of "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1bFr2SWP1I">Over the Rainbow</a>."  Joe followed up by playing, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FArZxLj6DLk">Hiphopopotomous</a>" by Flight of the Concords. Yeah, imagine that on a ukulele.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My coworker Andy was pretty handy with the ukulele and caught on quickly. He strummed along on a tiny pink uke that happened to be sitting behind us. I learned the "C", which is really all I need to know since it's the pirate's favorite cord. It's the third fret on the first string. Not to hard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Joan Marie promised me ukulele lessons if I bought the boat. It was a hard sell.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We played so much ukulele that we were almost an hour late to the documentary <em>Indie Games</em>, which is why I'm not going to post a movie review. From now on though, Fridays will be film review days on the blog.</p>

      <title>Yacht Clubbing</title>
      <link>/writing/114</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.6032153943087906"></strong>The best time to look at a boat is in the rain. If you love it in the rain, you will love it even more in the sun. I had planned to bike over to see it, but I arrived home from work looking like a drowned rat with my fingers frozen into the handlebar position. My thumbs were so numb that I couldn’t even move them enough to shift gears, so I had to use the side of my hand. When I walked in the house dripping wet, my awesome uncle and aunt told me to just take their car to go see the boat. So I did.</p>
<p>Driving in Seattle is weird. Main roads have two lanes - one is for traffic that is turning (but it’s not a turning lane) and one is for traffic that is going straight. If you’re in one lane at rush hour it’s pretty much impossible to get into the other. Also, there are confusing double stoplights. Anyway, I made it all the way to the boat without getting run over and I even found the McGinnis Marina, an industrial looking place near the locks on Lake Union with giant tug boats and fishing boats towering over a handful of tiny sailboats.
The owner, “B”, welcomed me aboard his 30’ Newport where his wife was waiting. They took me over the boat and explained all the parts to me. I felt a little more comfortable telling the owners that I was clueless this time. The more you know about something the more comfortable you feel admitting that you don’t know anything. Not that I know much about boats. I found that out when they asked me if I would like to take it out for a spin since the rain was letting up. Would I like to? Are boogers salty?</p>
<p>I gripped the wheel as I motored the boat away from the dock. Driving a boat is a sensation of extreme power. I had never driven anything this large. If I wanted to, I could have caused thousands of dollars worth of damage to this boat or any of the other boats in the lake. I probably could have even sunk some of the other ships if I had rammed them hard enough. I could have run over kayakers or canoes or anything smaller than me and caused havoc. It was an incredible feeling. No wonder Blackbeard became a booty-plundering pirate.</p>
<p>The wind picked up so we raised the headsail.I’m sure there’s a better expression than that in sailor lingo but I don’t have time to look it up right now so I'll just say "Luff Cringle" again. "Luff Cringle." I sailed for approximately three whole minutes. Then B and his wife decided that that was enough of that and told me to head back to the slip. B took the wheel from me before we docked the boat. He must have noticed that glimmer of power in my eyes and he probably didn’t trust me to not ram the boat into the dock. Trying to be helpful, I tied the boat to the dock with a half hitch, which I had learned the other night in Des Moines. B took my half-hitch apart and re-tied it when he stepped off the boat. “Any more questions?” B asked. I told him that was it and I’d be in touch. Then I headed to the Corinthian Yacht Club for their Cinco De Mayo/Opening Day Party.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure whether to walk in or not, since the sign on the door said “Members Only” and I wasn’t yet a member. But I spotted my friends inside and they waved me in. The party had already been going on for a couple of hours and the tabletop was littered in empty bottles and glasses. The conversation had turned to weigh-ins at races.
“I always volunteer to man the scales when the Italian men are weighing in. They literally don’t wear anything for their weigh-ins! They just strip right down to the buff!” Exclaimed the elderly lady across from me. The table of women sailors erupted into laughter.
“I always watch them and I’m thinking ‘do they realize that that’s illegal in this country?’ But I certainly hope they don’t!”</p>
<p>All the women talked about the benefits of having a heavier crew. Finally I've found a sport where I can put my love of eating to good use!</p>
<p>Half of the women at my table had sailed around the world at some point. I was in awe, but I realized that we actually had a lot in common - I was able to talk to them about the cliff divers in Acapulco and hanging out on nude beaches on the coast of France. They welcomed me as a Seattle newbie, and talked about the what they loved about living in Seattle, such as being able to sail on day and ski the next. Which happened to be what my plan was for the weekend.</p>
<p>And we all agreed that “There is nothing half so much fun as messing about in boats.”</p>
<p>Which is exactly what I did all day Saturday on lake Whatcom in Bellingham. My coworker Andy took me and we met his friends and sailed from noon until five in the alternately rainy and sunny weather. Since we hadn’t tipped the boat, Andy and I decided to celebrate by diving into the lake. I don’t know why this always happens. It just happens.</p>
<p>I took a dive off the dock and as I hit the water I felt the shock of the cold immediately freeze me hands into the t-rex position. I tried to swim to the dock but I could barely doggy paddled with my clenched-up muscles, and when I got to the dock I wasn’t able to lift myself with my jelly muscles out so Andy’s friend Leo had to give me a hand. Even so, standing on the dock in the mild sunshine I felt rejuvenated. There is nothing like diving into a freezing lake to make you feel like you’re alive.</p>
<p>Tonight, Monday night, I returned to the Corinthian Yacht Club for my first official sailing lesson with Stark. We hadn’t read the chapter of “Getting Started In Sailboat Racing” that we were supposed to read, so I read it aloud in the car and we started to pick up the lingo, like “Spinnaker pole,” “Leeward,” and “Windward.” Somehow, amazingly, we made it there ten minutes early. We were probably the youngest people in the room and the people with the least amount of sailing experience but we didn’t care. Actually, I think we might have also been the most excited people to be there. “I can’t believe this is actually happening,” Stark said as we left. “We’re going to be sailors.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>East Coast Skier meet West Coast Snow</title>
      <link>/writing/116</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven't skied a wide variety of slopes. Blue Knob, Seven Springs, Tussey Mountain (where I taught) in Pennsylvania. Valle Nevado in Chile. And that's it.  I never got to go skiing in France because I was rocking a broken wrist the entire ski season. I never got to go skiing on the United State's west coast because I had never been to the west coast until March of this year. But now I'm here - probably for good. And I have no excuse, not even the excuse of having left all of my equipment back in PA, because they have rentals here. And since Steven's Pass, only an hour away, is open until May 6th, I really had no excuse. Not that I wanted an excuse not to go skiing. So I went.
My guide, Jeff, decided that the first thing we were going to do was go up the Tye Mill lift and ski some black diamond powder. At the top of the lift, taking pictures in front of the incredible backdrop (I asked Jeff if it was ok if I kept saying "Oh wow." "That's why I brought you here," he told me) we met a couple who had met skiing and were on their 47th year of skiing together. They were smiling all over. The man, well into his 70s, told us that he is learning how to butter. Groovy!</p>
<p>Powder...I don't know if I've ever seen powder in real life, let alone skied it. I've seen the pictures of the skiers whooshing down the slopes up to their waists in powder who look like they're causing an avalanche with their awesomeness. We skirted around the edge of the slope until we found some - soft, fresh and perfectly white. I didn't cause an avalanche, but I still felt kind of awesome.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill they had set up a giant air-filled trampoline underneath an 18 foot jump. "Do you want to go try that?" Jeff asked me. "I'm 60% sure that I do," I said. "But let's go ski some more and then I'll be 100%." So we went and skied the rest of the mountain. Jeff had brought an extra pair of headphones and a double jack so that I could listen to his ipod on the lift with him, but I realized that we were getting fewer runs in because we had to unplug everything at the top of the mountain, and that took an extra five seconds off the time that we could have been skiing. I danced to my own mountain music. As Jeff said, skiing is dancing on a snow-covered mountain (while wearing long skinny boards attached to your feet).</p>
<p>When we got down again for lunch, the line for the jump had grown to fifty or more, they were playing music, and everyone was watching from the lodge balcony. Seeing everyone watching, I went from being 100% sure that I wanted to try it to 0% sure. So instead, we watched with everyone else as we feasted on smushed up sesame crackers, pretzel crumbs, and melting chocolate. In fact, I was melting. It was so hot that there were girls skiing in bikinis. Actually, it wasn't hot enough for that, but they were doing it anyway. On the slopes I also saw some pirates, a clown, and a unicorn. I was looking for Waldo but I never found him.</p>
<p>Jeff and I danced some ski-boot swing to the music in front of the lodge and then went back up the mountain to get some more runs in before the mountain officially closed for summer. We caught the last lift up at 4pm, and waited at the top on a rock in the sun until all of the skiers had gone down. The lift guy skied by and hassled us. "After me there's no one left if you hurt yourself." he told us.</p>
<p>"What a goober," I said to Jeff as he passed. The guy obviously heard me because he turned around and laughed. "You guys have fun," he said. "You have to be careful," Jeff advised me. "Sound carries here a little too well."</p>
<p>The mountain host came by on his last run and asked to take our picture. "You guys are great," he said, and left. We were the last ones there. Then, like the curtain call of a play, we stood and skied down, one long, last run, to the bottom.</p>
<p>Except that it wasn't really that graceful, because Jeff got distracted by watching his own shadow in the snow and did an incredible face plant. Not that I hadn't already done a few of those earlier...</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill, they had closed the rental shop where all of our stuff was stored, so we had to hunt down someone who could open it up for us. Thankfully, we found someone, and managed to make it back in time for me to make dinner for Stark, Victor S, and friends.</p>
<p>*Thanks to Scott for the title!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Date with Monica</title>
      <link>/writing/119</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I finally got around to scheduling a date with my all time favorite person. On my google calendar in a light lavender box, from 10pm - 12:30am, I have "Date with Monica" written in. It's been a while since I've been planning this, and I keep flaking out, but I've finally written it in my calendar, and my calendar is what dictates my fate. I'll probably read some books. Maybe I'll write a blog post or an email or two. I might even eat something, or do some yoga. I'm extremely excited, and a little worried that I might flake out again...but I won't.

      <title>Glenfiddich Scotch Tasting</title>
      <link>/writing/122</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may have happened a week ago, but's never too late to write about an enjoyable Scotch Tasting. You know you're an adult where you actually go to a scotch tasting and sip glasses of fine, aged scotch rather than mixing your friend's parent's scotch with coke and chugging it at a sloppy house party. Not that I ever did that.
Last Thursday I had the privilege to a Glenfiddich Scotch Tasting at Seattle's secret startup basement, "<a href="http://www.founderscoop.com/">The Easy</a>" (@founderscoop).</p>
<p>While waiting for the event to start (and I did wait, despite the fact that three glasses of scotch were sitting at my place, tempting me) I took pictures with new friends in the photobooth, provided by <a href="http://www.zagat.com/">Zagat</a>, one of the event sponsors. I now have pictures of Mitch Bechard (@GlenfiddichMB, our host, wearing a pink feather boa and feather hat. Blackmail? Likewise, Peter Fosso (@peterfosso) was a good enough sport to put on some funky glasses and take pictures. I didn't even have to ask Jeff Shilling (@coctailparty) to take silly pictures - he was more than willing to don a gladiator outfit and ham it up in the photo booth.</p>
<p>After taking pictures, Mitch became (somewhat) professional and gave us the Glenfiddich spiel. I don't know much about scotch so it was very informative for me. We tried a twelve year, a fifteen year and and eighteen year scotch. All three were aged in American wood barrels. I learned how to add a couple of drops of water using an eyedropper to take the edge off of the scotch. My favorite was the eighteen year, and after the tasting I enjoyed a glass with the delicious buffet. Thanks to Charles Koh (@charleskoh) for hosting a great event!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Startup Weekend Starts Up!</title>
      <link>/writing/126</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was so excited for bike-to-work day this morning that I forgot to bring my laptop to work and barely made it to Startup Weekend. It takes me an hour to bike home, and another forty minutes to bike into Seattle. Guess how much time I had given myself to get from work to an event that starts at 5pm ? None. Zilch. Somehow I tend to bypass the mundane parts of existence, like eating, sleeping, and commute. I needed my laptop though, so I left work as early as I decently could and caught the bus using the most useful app I’ve downloaded so far,  "<a href="http://www.onebusaway.org/">One Bus Away</a>" that accurately tells you the time of the next bus that is close to you. I’d love to personally shake the hand of the inventor of this app. Unfortunately, it couldn’t entirely save me from my absent mind.
I watched the sun glinting off of Lake Washington as I surfed my new phone and tried to come up with an idea to pitch. I got off the bus and started to walk home to where my laptop was waiting. Suddenly I had a feeling of emptiness. My bike ! My bike was still on the bus ! The bus had pulled away and was gathering speed as it hurtled down 25th Ave. There was only one thing to do. I sprinted. I sprinted hard. Somehow I found myself reaching up and rapping on the driver’s window. The stunned driver stopped the bus (there had been a change of drivers halfway through the route, so she didn’t know that the bike on the front was mine). She just stared at me, incomprehensive for a second.</p>
<p>"My bike !"  I shouted. "My bike!" That’s when she understood. Rush hour traffic was gathering behind us and there was no place for the bus to pull over, so she motioned for me to take it off quickly. I managed to get my bike off in record time, and I even had time to pick up my laptop from the apartment and catch the bus downtown, where I somehow found my way to Startup Weekend. That’s where I am now and that’s where I will be for the next 54 hours. Expect periodic updates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle Startup Weekend - Friday Night</title>
      <link>/writing/129</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday night. Or is it Saturday morning ? I’m headed home on the bus now since they closed up 92 Lenora Street to keep people from sleeping over.
Upon arriving at the venue, a derelict building that had been repainted and is still being refinished in an open, loft style, I was greeted by the event coordinators and handed a name tag on a red lanyard. I soon realized that red lanyards were for designers, blue lanyards for developers, yellow lanyards for business people, and green lanyards for event coordinators. White lanyards were for mentors and speakers.</p>
<p>One of our speakers was tetris grand master Kevin Z Birrell (@kevinddr). He spoke on the power of determination and how it had helped him to improve to the level of TGM, or tetris grand master. I'm pretty sure that that's the level of tetris where the pieces are invisible and you have to guess where they're going to land. Afterwards we did an icebreaker where we had to pitch a company based on two key words that were given to us. Our team's were pitchfork and dental floss, so we came up with "Tridental, the world's first social flossing." A flosser attaches to your iphone and tracks each time you floss your teeth and sends a message to your friends, your mom, and your dentist to let them know that you've flossed. Someone please invent this in real life!</p>
<p>After the ice breaker I wandered around the floor, awkwardly extending my hand to anyone I made eye contact with and introducing myself. « Hi, I’m Monica, » I would say to anyone who would listen. I had thought up a brief pitch – an idea that I had been thinking of for a while and had revisited while on the bus on the way there.  People seemed to like my idea, so when it was time I went ahead and pitched it. At least thirty people were pitching – probably a quarter of the crowd. Everyone was given 60 seconds to tell the crowd their vision. Someone pushed me in the right direction and I found myself on the podium holding a microphone in my hand. I started into my pitch, introducing myself to the crowd and giving an off-the-cuff intro. Suddenly, I ran out of words. I stared around awkwardly, opening and closing my mouth like a fish as my mind churned. The more I thought about what I was supposed to say, the less I knew what I was going to say, until I realized that I didn’t even know what I was doing anymore. My mind was blank. Suddenly I remembered « So we really need app developers ! » I managed to shout before the timer buzzed. I handed the microphone back to the coordinator and he smiled at me. I jumped off the stage and slunk to the back. Someone came up to me and congratulated me on my "good pitch." I realized that what had seemed like several minutes of awkwardness had only lasted a couple of seconds in reality.</p>
<p>I watched the rest of the pitches. Some of them were brilliant. A team of therapists was pitching kinect games for autistic children. « SeaBNB » aimed to use the berths on board empty boats as hotel rooms.</p>
<p>After the pitches were over, the name of each pitch was written on a sheet of paper and taped to the wall. We each had been given three sticky notes, and these counted as our three votes. Whichever three ideas you liked best you stuck a sticky note to. I hung out in line for the one bathroom as people cast their votes. When I got back, I was surprised to see the results. My pitch had a thick coating of sticky notes. It had been chosen as one of the final groups!</p>
<p>Now it was time to assemble a crew. A whole host of electrical engineering students who happen to be awesome app devs gathered around our team. Two designers agreed that they were in. Several business people also joined us and began talking business plans and monetization. The final headcount was thirteen, but one of the coordinators came over and told us that we needed to thin out a bit, since that size group tended to be unwieldy and there were some groups that needed more people. We ended up with nine people and I volunteered myself to be the coordinator and liaison between developers, designers, and business people. Work started around 10pm and the hours passed quickly as we tried to come up with a viable plan of action.</p>
<p>At midnight they kicked us out so we headed to Belltown Billiards to get our groove on. Work hard, play hard.</p>
<p>I'll be back at 92 Lenora Avenue at 9am. Til then, I'll be trying to get some Z's.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Girl Power Hour</title>
      <link>/writing/140</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m not going to lie. I was leary about going to an event called «Fit and Fab(ulous) ». I go out of my way to avoid anything that talks about nutrition, excercise or weight loss, since I think that women in our culture are already overdosed with these things. Sure, I’ll read Running Times, or obsess over sports equipment, or join a climbing gym, but that’s different. I do these things partly for the enjoyment of physical exertion and partly for the mental edge I think they give me (believe me, I need all the help I can get). I could give a shnitzel if I gain or lose twenty pounds.
So why did I go ? Well, I’ve started to miss my girlfriends since I’ve been in Seattle and going to one of the <a href="http://girlpowerhour.com">Girl Power Hour</a> (@girlpowerhour) seemed like it would be a good chance to meet more women friends. I think the activities that I choose to attend – like Startup Weekend, for instance – are great for meeting guy friends but aren’t so good for meeting girls. My workplace is also about 70% men. In some ways I love this – I feel like it’s easier to keep my priorities straight.  A lot of times when I’m around women there is pressure to focus on babies, relationships, and appearance, three things that are at the bottom of the totem pole of my priorities (if they’re even on the totem pole).</p>
<p>This event seemed like it would be a place where I could meet like-minded women, since Girl Power Hour is especially designed for women who are interested in having a life outside of the « domestic » sphere.</p>
<p>Actually, missing my girlfriends wasn’t the only reason that I chose to go to the event. Sunday, with the exhileration of the presentation and the afterparty, I had completely forgotten my bicycle at startup weekend. In fact, when I arrived home from work on Monday I didn’t even know where my bike was and I thought it had been stolen for a couple of anxious minutes. Thankfully, when my memory of the weekend returned, I called the owner of the venue, "<a href="http://www.themakersspace.com/">Makers</a>", Caitlyn , and she said that she could hold onto my bike until Girl Power Hour, which was held at the same venue. I think I spend more time chasing my bike around town than I do riding it.</p>
<p>Maker’s is a beautiful coworking space in the middle of Belltown. It is open, light, and airy. The accent pieces, like an antique organ, are placed so that they add to the zen rather than clutter the place.  I was an hour and a half late to the event because I had spent the afternoon at a boat brokerage and then trying to get a Seattle Driver’s license at the DOL. Even though I say that I don’t give a shnitzel if I gain or lose 20 pounds, I was a little nervous as I struggled to zip up the back of my skirt. Over the past two weeks I have been too busy to run, and all of the free food at work had gone straight to my rear. I did manage to zip it up, however, and even though it is a tiny pencil skirt and I have to get into cars butt first and climb stairs sideways, I felt, well, kind of fabulous. On the way to the bus stop I almost bumped into several people because I was admiring myself in the glass storefronts.</p>
<p>Ironically, the first thing I heard when I walked through the door was a woman on a podium talking about how by excercising she had managed to add two whole inches to her butt. « Wow, » I remarked to a girl standing next to me. « I did that without even exercising. » I decided to go keep working on my butt by hitting the hors d’ouvres table.</p>
<p>The speakers themselves were fabulous. My fear about having to listen to judgemental talks about how many calories are in a spoonful of peanut butter was qualmed when I heard the vulnerable, inspiring talks on how to change our image from the inside out. I have never seen so many beautiful women in one place in Seattle. I met the organizers’ mother at the buffet table, a rockstar lady with little glasses. « Those are my daughters, » she told me, proudly. I found myself wishing my own mother were there.</p>
<p>There were women of all ages in the room, and although I was interested in meeting peers, it was also lovely to connect to some women older than myself. Two ladies introduced themselves. It was obvious from how they carried themselves that they were badasses. We started a conversation that immediately went deeper than the normal networking fluff. Laurie, a ballet dancer by trade, leaned toward me and offered me this advice : « Don’t even think about getting married for the next five years. Don’t waste your time in relationships. Be selfish. Have fun. »</p>
<p>This is the lesson that I took away with me from Girl Power Hour (although I’m not certain that it’s endorsed by the event). Laurie happened to have a  bike rack on her car, so she offered me a ride home. « See, » she said as I strapped my bike onto her car « I was meant to give you a ride home. » We drove past a statue of a giant popsickle and Laurie said «I have to get a picture of that, » so we circled around, jumped out of the car, and had a stranger take a picture of us pretending to lick it. Girls are awesome.</p>
<p>When I got home and opened the Seattle Times, it opened straight to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHFA_enUS484US484&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=sting%2C+shes+just+not+that+into+youle">this article</a> which I thought was strangely relevant. Here's a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back when Snow White sang, "Someday my prince will come," waiting on a prince — and raising his babies afterward — constituted pretty much a woman's entire range of options. Seventy-five years later, women have options their grandmothers could scarcely have dreamed. So is it asking too much that we relegate this tired narrative to the junk heap where it belongs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Talk about girl power!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Rothrock Challenge</title>
      <link>/writing/142</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything ached as I threw one leg after the other in front of me in a lopsided shuffle-run. "Monica, the faster you run this, the faster you can take a nap at the end," I told myself. I sped up, despite the forty-five degree angle of the hill. Then I stopped, gasping, and walk lopingly up the remainder of the hill. I had lost my fellow Rec Hall Regular, Jim, on the first painful 1,200 foot climb at the beginning of the race, and Meira Minard, reigning champion of Rothrock Challenges, was already in the lead, so I found myself in a pack of random runners. I imagined Jim and Meira soaring ahead of me and I felt like crying with frustration. The alternate joy of knowing I was doing my best and anguish of knowing that my best wasn't going to win me a medal today was messing with my head.
I hate not winning. I had entered this race hoping to win at least something, but exhaustion from jet lag had worn me out. At least that's what I told myself. I jogged along, making a thousand excuses for my poor performance. I didn't get any coffee this morning. I hadn't carb loaded. I was wearing the wrong shoes (I'm not even sure what the right shoes for a race like that are). I hadn't trained. Wait, that's not an excuse. I could have trained. As my mind wandered I began to mentally make up a training program. I realized that running was fifth on my list of priorities. No wonder I hadn't trained. I need to put running and sleeping enough at the top of my priority list. I know, I will cancel all of my dates, tell my friends I don't have time to see them, and run twelve miles a day every day...</p>
<p>Suddenly I soared into a patch of sunlight which glinted off the wet leaves of the mountain laurel. The sunlight brought me back to the present, to the beautiful day, and to the soreness in my feet. The weather was as bipolar as my mood. A hard rain last night had left the course slippery. I had already passed through waist deep water in one part of the course. The worst spots were the technical spots right after the creek, when my shoes were full of water and slippery and I had trouble balancing as I leapt from rock to rock. And yet, I love technical. I love the absolute focus that it requires. My mind goes completely blank as I focus on finding the next best foothold for my airborne feet.</p>
<p>It was humid. At each water station I dumped a cup of water over my head. A couple of times I found myself running completely alone, the ferns brushing gently against my legs. I got lost twice. At the last water station, the lady told me "you're at mile twelve," but I knew she was lying when, three miles in, a man on a bike called out "only five and a half more miles to go!" There were two more climbs and descents in those last five miles. Another woman passed me and I felt frustration again. The man ahead of me had perfect balance and owned the technical, but his love handles suggested that he wasn't a regular runner. I felt angry about being behind him and not being in the lead. Then suddenly, I noticed the view and realized that I was running in a beautiful forest on a beautiful day and I smiled a huge smile and just ran for the pleasure of running. I realized that it didn't matter that I wasn't winning - being out there, running my best and being humbled by this terrain were the point.</p>
<p>I flew down the last hill like only a skier can run, passing a dozen runners on my way down. The last runner I passed was a guy who I'd been playing leapfrog with all day, and as I pulled away from him he yelled at me "Nice job! You're awesome by the way!!" That was the only push I needed to finish the race running. The rest of the way was mostly downhill. The final half mile was the one stretch of pavement. I closed my eyes and felt thankful for having the life to run and feel this pain and joy. I passed the finish line at 4:11 and ran straight to the pond to jump in. Jim was there with his hand out to give me a high five. So was Tom Cali, who had run part of the race to help encourage Meira. I was 10th woman overall. No, I'm not happy with my place. But I know that I will train harder from now on. Also, never run a race when jet-lagged. Unless it's reverse jet lag. My next race will have to be in Hawaii...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Home is Where Your Family Is</title>
      <link>/writing/146</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worst thing about flying East is that you lose hours. I boarded a plane at 6am Friday morning, took a six hour nap, and when I woke up it was already 3pm and I was in Philadelphia. The weather there was balmy and muggy. English has the strangest words to describe weather. Philadelphia wasn’t the end of my journey as I still had a four hour bus ride to State College. Also, I had to catch my bus, which I wasn’t entirely sure how to do. I’m pretty sure the expression 'fly by the seat of your pants' was created with me in mind. Luckily I had my handy dandy android to tell me what train to catch to take me to the bus station where I needed to be in half an hour. What did people do before smart phones ? I guess they actually figured out where they were going <em>before </em>boarding the plane.
I took another nap on the bus home. Thankfully nobody was there to take pictures, since I think I was drooling. I woke up to a downpour and the driver announcing that we were half an hour late, which gave me just enough time to think about how I would describe my time in Seattle to my parents. I went over everything I had done since moving to Seattle…</p>
<p>The day I arrived at my new home, a little over a month ago, the sun was glinting off Lake Washington. I had to be at work the next afternoon to sign some papers, but since my job didn’t start until April 23rd I had a whole week to rest up, run, and meet friends. I didn’t realize then how much I would need that extra rest. The group of runners I met that week (via meetup) would lead directly or indirectly to me meeting every single friend I have met so far in Seattle (other than my coworkers).</p>
<p>On my first Sunday I travelled to eastern Washington for my cousin’s track meet and saw grey velvet hills, scrubby tumbleweeds and lone ranches that I had only read about in books. The next weekend I found myself climbing in Leavenworth after a full weekend of partying (and a lovely pause on Saturday where I went to the farmer’s market and helped a friend cook an amazing vegan meal). Monday was my first day of work… After Monday, things started to accelerate like a…well, like a rolling stone. I convinced five people to take off their clothes and jump into Green Lake with me. I went to a party at the Corinthian Yacht Club and then dressed up to make an appearance at Bonza Bash on the same night. I travelled up and down Puget Sound looking at boats and learning how to determine what boat to buy. I signed up for sailboat racing lessons and got a membership at Vertical World climbing gym. I went to a Sounder’s game, went sailing in Bellingham, skied at Steven’s pass on the last day of ski season, stayed up all night dancing with my friends Scott and Adan, joined a yacht club, went to a party on a boat and jumped into Puget Sound afterwards, led a project at Startup Weekend, went to my first Duck Dodge, and networked at Girl Power Hour. I managed to get around Seattle without a car and only lost my bike a couple of times (and then found it again). I started an exercise fad at work, learned how to throw a frisbee (only got one bloody nose in the process) and tried slacklining. I planned a weekend trip to Smith Rock with my coworker Andy, went to see my cousin tapdance in his highschool play, and finally headed home for this weekend’s double feature – 30K and wedding in one day. At the wedding, my friend’s great Aunt Ruthie told me "I’m 75. I wish that I could live to be <em>four hundred</em> and seventy five because there is SO much to do!" I think I know what she means.</p>
<p>I've done a lot since I've been in Seattle, but isn't what I've done that makes Seattle the best city in the US as far as I'm concerned. It's the friends I've made. If I hadn't met those friends, Seattle would have been just another chilly, rainy city. Because I met them, Seattle is now home and they are my surrogate family.</p>
<p>Of course, I love being with my real family also. I woke up in my parent’s house Sunday morning to the smell of eggs and bacon. The sun was shining outside and everything was as it should be. Things never change in State College. We had a family breakfast where they told me about our dog Mungo’s new affinity for rabbit-catching. She’s five years old and she just learned how to catch rabbits. She is so excited by it that apparently she sneaks out of the house when my parents aren’t looking and runs away to track them. Most of the time she tracks them backwards though, so she’s sniffing in one direction while the lucky rabbit happily hops off in the other direction.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you have everything?" My mom asked me about twenty times before I left. "Yes, certain. I’m a travelling expert." "Hah!" My Dad scoffed. "A travelling expert? Remember that time in Mexico City when you threw away the stamp you needed to leave the country and we had to sprint across the airport to try to get a new one?" That’s the problem with parents. They never forget all of the embarrassing things you did. "That was six years ago Dad! I’ve learned since then!" I protested. But in the car on the way to the bus stop I suddenly realized that I didn’t have my passport. I jumped into the back of the van and started tearing my luggage apart. I found the missing passport inside of a notebook in my suitcase, where it had fallen and gotten wedged between the pages.</p>
<p>When we got to Philly the megabus driver couldn’t find a place to park so he yelled to us as he circled the block, "Y’all think you can jump out right quick and grab yo bags ?" I was the only person who shouted "yeah!" The driver parked illegally in a city bus lane, shooed us out and started to throw us our bags. "Quick people, grab yo bags and get outta here!" He shouted. "Y’all don see no po-lice comin? Grab dem bags!"</p>
<p>I was taking my sewing machine, snowboard accessories and snowboard back to Seattle with me so I checked them in at the counter at the airport. Or rather, I tried to check them in. When the concierge asked how I would be paying for them, I replied "credit" and opened my wallet to discover that the credit card slot was empty. I suddenly remembered that my credit card had been left in my parents car when I’d deposited some checks at the drive-through ATM that morning. "Uh…um…uh…." I stuttered. "Er, I have to make a phone call." I took my bags off the scale and moved out of the way as I dialed my parents. They must have been taking their Sunday afternoon nap because the phone rang and rang and nobody answered. I must have looked distressed because the concierge took compassion on me. "Do you have any cash? How much do you need? I’ll pay for them." The concierge, Vee, and I are now friends on facebook and I promised him a snowboarding lesson when he comes to Seattle. I still didn’t have a credit or a debit card, and I wasn’t sure how I would pay for the light rail to get home. Five minutes later, my phone rang. Another friend was  calling. "Hey, I was just thinking of you," he said.  "Do you need a ride home from the airport ?" "Uh, yes actually."</p>
<p>Later I found my credit card in my checked bag. Oops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lucky Flight</title>
      <link>/writing/15</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of how I ended up flying first class to Seattle.
Last week when I found out that I hadn't gotten a driveaway I sadly bought the cheapest ticket I could find to Seattle. It had layovers in Detroit, Kansas City, and St. Paul. I had packed my bags to take as much weight I could possibly carry. I love flying but this seemed like it was was going to be the flight from hell.</p>
<p>I got to the airport at 5am this morning after sleeping maybe one hour. I was checking two suitcases. When I weighed my first suitcase it weighed 58 pounds. Delta's weight limit is 50 pounds. Luckily the other suitcase weighed 42 pounds, so I just transferred the heavy stuff from one to the other.</p>
<p>On the plane I got to sit next to my friend Barb. Everything went smoothly and we got to Detroit early but my next flight was delayed because of technical problems. I waited for an hour and worked on <a title="Eloquent JavaScript" href="http://http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a> because there was no free WiFi (coincidentally, I finished four lessons in one sitting. Maybe not having internet is a good thing). Around 10am they informed us that the plane repair was not getting anywhere and gave us all meal vouchers for our patience. I told them that I'd just missed my connecting flights, so they gave me a first class ticket on the next direct flight to Seattle at 3:30pm. I hypnotized myself by walking back and forth in the magical Detroit airport tunnel until I was tired enough to take a nap.</p>
<p>The next flight was so full they asked us to check our carry-ons, but I still got to sit first class (I think I supplanted some people who were waiting for first class seats hehe). I've never ridden first class before so I wasn't really sure what to do. If this ever happens to you, just so you know, the tray is hidden in the armrest and you can ask for as many snacks and drinks as you want. Also, the meal is free. Don't worry about eating too much because there is lots of extra butt room in case you gain weight. I told the guy sitting next to me about my job and he gave me some good financial advice.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's as easy to love a rich guy as it is to love a poor guy. If you ever meet a guy you want to marry, save some money and send it back to your parents to save for you. Don't tell the guy. If you make it to your 25th anniversary you can break it out then and have an awesome second honeymoon."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Save, save, save, and invest, invest, invest. Make sure you save some money every month, and start saving now. I'm sure you'll do great!"</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm sure I'll do great too! I got to Seattle early and found out that my bags had gotten lost somewhere on the four flight changes they had done without me and weren't due for another hour. For the "inconvenience" they gave me some more meal vouchers. Cool.</p>

      <title>Running Revisited</title>
      <link>/writing/151</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After going through hell at the 30K on Saturday (and not winning anything) I decided not to skip running practice anymore. That meant that Tuesday I went to "Getting Back on the Track" with the Antifreeze running group. It was pouring rain so there were only a few of us there. On a good day there are ten or fifteen people. We did six 800s.
I've been getting queezy every time I run track. I'm not sure if it's motion sickness or if it's caused by my diet or drinking too much coffee at work or something else. It usually hits at about the middle of track practice, and I slow down because I feel like my guts are about to burst. I try to hang on, even though I fall to the back of the pack. I've tried running with my eyes half closed, staring at the sky, eating less at lunch and not drinking coffee. So far nothing has helped. Maybe I just need to do more track practices. I've been skipping for the past couple of weeks because things like Duck Dodge get in the way. If anybody knows any tips for not getting sick while running track, please let me know!</p>
<p>SSW (Matt Winberry's acronym) was there as always, keeping up a good pace. At the end of practice, he asked me and Tony, "Do you want to run Ragnar?" and we both said yes without a minute of thought. So now we're signed up for <a href="http://www.ragnarrelay.com/race/northwestpassage">this</a>. Something to train for. Which meant that tonight, even though I was exhausted from Wednesday night "tapering" (swing dancing in Bellingham most of the night and waking up at 4am to make it to work on time) I woke from my post-work power nap to get to Road Runner Sports "First Thursday Adventure Run" run by 7pm. This was my first time at a First Thursday, and I didn't realize what a big deal it was.  First Thursday Adventure Runs are scavenger hunts where you run from business to business claiming prizes and raffle tickets. I was ten minutes late, but there was still a huge crowd gathered outside of Road Runner Sports. They seemed to be a lot more festive than the usual Thursday group is pre-run. I realized that everyone had cups of beer and handfuls of raffle tickets. A large percentage were wearing blue "First Thursday" t-shirts. I managed to find Matt and Tony in the crowd and asked them what was going on.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, where did you get the raffle tickets?"</p>
<p>"Monica, where have you been? We got the tickets on the run of course. They hand them out on the scavenger hunt"</p>
<p>"The run? You guys ran already?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, this started at 5pm"</p>
<p>Wow. I was two hours late. Tony went to get another beer and handed me his tickets. The organizer was rapidly reading out the raffle winners and I tried to keep up. They were giving away t-shirts, backpacks, shoes and all sorts of sports goodies. I felt pretty disappointed that I'd missed out on all this awesome. I would have to wait another month for the next one. Suddenly I heard the announcer say "Monica...Monica Simone..."</p>
<p>"Hey, that's you!" Matt nudged me. They had drawn my name from a hat. Somehow I had won something even though I was two hours late and hadn't participated in the Adventure Run. I squeezed through the crowd and claimed my prize - $160 towards a new pair of Asics, $25 at Irwins Coffee Shop, and entries to six summer races! Apparently since I had RSVPd online they had drawn my name from the pool of RSVPers. Now I get to run six races AND Ragnar!</p>
<p>Sometimes just showing up is the whole battle.</p>
<p>I did go for a five mile jog later that night - just me and the lake breeze and the shadowy figures of lovers strolling around Greenlake, whispering in the trees. Running, I've missed you.</p>

      <title>50 Days of Morning Yoga</title>
      <link>/writing/154</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I don't feel like biking to work, I carpool every now and then with one of my coworkers, Drew. About a month ago we were talking about stress back problems and I encouraged Drew to try yoga. A week ago, I rode to work with him again and he seemed extremely satisfied.
"Thanks so much for suggesting that I try yoga," he gushed. "I've been doing fifteen minutes every morning for the past week and it's totally changed my outlook on life."</p>
<p>I felt like an idiot. Do as I say, not as I do. I hadn't done a lick of yoga in over a month and my lifestyle hasn't been exactly zen. In fact, I'm such a doer that the things that I do, which started out as enjoyable outlets for my excess energy, have started to cause more stress than joy. Even hanging out with friends sometimes feels like a chore - I'm thinking about the next task while I'm with them and I'm wishing I were at home working on my projects instead of with them. And once I get home, as I work on my projects, I start thinking about work the next day and worrying about how tired I'm going to be. This creates an endless cycle of worry, since I can't keep up with myself anymore. My tasks have taken over my life. That's when I have to stop and regroup.</p>
<p>I can handle a huge number of tasks as long as I stay in the moment during each of them and give each my all. For instance, when I go sailboat racing I have to be focused solely on getting the most out of the boat's sails, training my muscle memory to jibe and tack, and if I have a free second, enjoying the wind in my face and the salt air of the sound. I can't be thinking about the fact that I have rock-climbing in an hour, or that I'm going dancing after that. In other words, I have to FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND.</p>
<p>The best way to do that is the one I always preach to friends and haven't been following myself: 15-30 minutes of yoga before work in the morning. For the next 50 days I've decided to challenge myself to get back into it. Feel free to follow along if you like - I'd love to hear about your experiences doing 50 days of yoga. I'm right at that swing in the moving process where the adrenaline of a new place and new friends starts to wear off and the stress of the daily grind starts to set in (if you let it). But I won't let it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow can worry about its own problems. I'm going to stay in the moment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Power of No</title>
      <link>/writing/158</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest luxuries about being an adult is that nobody can tell you what you can't do. Nobody can say "Monica, it's a week night. You shouldn't stay up late working on that stupid business idea because you have to wake up at 5am tomorrow and that's two hours from now." or " Monica, you have a sinus infection. You shouldn't go running tonight, and then go to an absinthe tasting, and then go Salsa Dancing until 3am."
It's also one of the most difficult things, at least for me. If there's nobody to tell me what I can't do, I end up doing everything at once.  Especially coming from a small town, the excitement of being invited to three or four events every night is a little overwhelming.</p>
<p>Which is why I am learning that <em>I never HAVE to do anything</em>. Another one of the greatest luxuries of being an adult is the power to say "No." "No," as in: "No, I'd rather not go to your cocktail party/windsurfing/Las Vegas. I would prefer to stay in tonight and read a book."</p>
<p>I think a lot of people forget that they have this basic human right.  You can say "no" to all sorts of things. You can even say "no" to work. You're sick. You're stressed. It's a beautiful sunny day out. You've been working hard all month. Say no to work and take a sick day. That's what they were designed for.</p>
<p>If you work for yourself, you can even say no to a client. "No," as in: "No, I'm not going to build this website for you because I already have a full work schedule. If you'd like, feel free to get on my wait list, but otherwise here's x's number - she's a great web designer also and would be happy to do this for you."</p>
<p>Conversely, you can also say no to social events because work is more meaningful to you. "No," as in: "No, I love hanging out with you but I also have an awesome job and I want to get a good night's sleep so that I can change the world one day at a time."</p>
<p>There's a whole list of other things you can say "No" to.</p>
<p>Say "No" to stress. Why worry? Things will either get done or they won't get done, but being stressed won't help.</p>
<p>Say "No" to your peers putting you down. If somebody says, "Monica, I can't believe it's already June and you don't live on a boat yet," I will reply: "go fry your head in a microwave," as I was taught to say in grade school. I do things in my own time.</p>
<p>Say "No" to people asking for more of your time than you want to give them. Some people are very needy. Just remind them gently that they need to find other friends because you aren't willing to be there for them at all times.</p>
<p>Say "No" to anything that bores you. Say "No" to people who sap your energy. Say "No" to situations that might become awkward. Say "No" to anything or anyone that doesn't challenge you. Say "No" to events that will be fun but that you can't enjoy because your schedule is already overbooked. Say "No" when you are tired. Say "No" when you really just want some alone time.</p>
<p>You never HAVE to do anything. Everything in life is a choice, so follow what excites you and keep growing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Just Focus Part 1</title>
      <link>/writing/160</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most members of my generation I have a terrible attention span. I have been known to be literally distracted by squirrels while trying to carry on a...SQUIRREL!I need all the help I can get with focus, especially when I have 50 tabs open in front of me on my work computer as well as my phone buzzing on my desk.</p>
<p>Besides yoga and distance running (there’s nothing like a long run to clear your head), my number one focusing tool right now is called a pomodoro. I discovered the pomodoro technique about a year ago, and occasionally use it when working on something that is time sensitive. Last week I realized that my productivity at work could use a boost. My outside life was distracting me from focusing, and my mind kept getting pulled away from my tasks by non-work related calls, texts, facebook messages and emails. So I did a quick search for a pomodoro app, and finally downloaded an app called “pomodroido.” http://www.pomodroido.com/</p>
<p>Smart phones are funny things. They can enhance your focus or they can destroy it. My phone was both the cause of my problems (the messages never stop) and the answer (my productivity apps now keep me on task).</p>
<p>So what is a pomodoro?
From the Pomodoro Technique website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a task to be accomplished</li>
<li>Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)</li>
<li>Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper</li>
<li>Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)</li>
<li>Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break (10 minutes is good)</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I started using pomodoros at work. I experimented with different lengths (for instance, working for 40 minutes and taking a 10 minute break) before deciding to stick with the default. For now, 30 minutes seems to be my maximum attention span. Even that was a bit much for the first week - it was a real effort to get to the end of the pomodoro without being distracted. Also, five minutes is not very long for a break. That’s barely enough time to pick your nose and check your favorite blog.</p>
<p>I feel like my focus has definitely gone up after two weeks of using these though. I’m almost ready to go up to a thirty minute pomodoro. The best thing that this does is that it minimizes the time I spend doing useless things like checking my email. If I get new mail during a pomodoro, instead of being pulled away from my task to check it I consciously choose to ignore it until the pomodoro is finished. My email can wait for 25 minutes. It’s not going anywhere. It could probably even wait for an hour to check my email, but I haven’t yet achieved that level of patience and focus.</p>
<p>I also realized that bigger chunks of time, like an entire day, can be used in a similar fashion. Rather than constantly juggle every detail of my life, I can set aside certain days to work on certain things. For instance, I can have a “personal finance day” once a month where I make sure that all my bills have been paid. Or I could have a “chores” day like my parents had when I was growing up, where I do household chores like vacuuming and laundry.
Days have been traditionally set aside for different chores, as proven in this old English poem:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Wash on Monday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Iron on Tuesday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Bake on Wednesday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Brew on Thursday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Churn on Friday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Mend on Saturday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Go to meeting on Sunday.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we live in an awesome time when we don’t have to spend an entire day washing (or go to meeting on Sunday) but dividing weeks like this could certainly help with focus. Here is a modern version of the poem that fits my lifestyle better:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Build websites and climb on Monday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Go to track practice or duck dodge and pay bills on Tuesday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">learn Windows 8 and go salsa dancing on Wednesday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Run, climb and study app design at the library on Thursday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Climb, party and network on Friday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Leave town on Saturday,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr">Come home and take a nap on Sunday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not really as catchy as the original poem but it certainly reflects my more modern life.</p>
<p>Historically, humans have always divided their lives into smaller portions and even though these portions, like minutes, hours and weeks, have nothing to do with the seasons or the stars, they make sense. Whether you use a traditional seven day week or a ten day week (like they created during the French Revolution) or an eight day week like the early Romans (or the Beatles), dividing your time into weeks helps to create a certain structure and routine, which can help to make your life more organized.
Of course, sometimes I <em>do</em> cheat on the pomodoros.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Follow Your Play</title>
      <link>/writing/followyourplay</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always figured that my true calling would find me. My Dad is a pastor, and he always talked about being "called" to the ministry. My Mom, similarly, talked about being "called" to motherhood. So in high school, my overachiever friends started to pick their majors and the best college that would help them down that path, but I waited. And when I got tired of waiting, I travelled. Halfway around the world, however, I still hadn't found my calling, and my calling hadn't found me.</p><p>Obviously, my calling had to be something that it's possible to be passionate about. Something like music, or art, or drama. Those are the callings that are portrayed as being higher, almost spiritual. You see it in the media. Paganini, who practiced violin 16 hours a day. Coltrane, who played jazz until his lips bled. Van Gogh, and the countless crazy artists who followed him, who stayed up day and night creating and ingested all sorts of substances and finally killed themselves as a final sacrifice to their art.</p><p>Growing up in 20th Century America, I was well-off enough not to be put to work in the coal mines (as my Grandpa's older brothers were). The mines might have solved my existential crisis about <em>what to do.</em>&nbsp;As it was, however, I knew from what everybody told me that what I did had to be enjoyable. Of course, my parents reminded me that everything takes hard work. Life can't always be fun. And they really wouldn't mind if I studied business. Or medicine.</p><p>So when I went to college, I chose to study film, with a minor in business just in case because my parents insisted. I dropped the business minor after my first economics class.&nbsp;I stuck with film however, since it was subjective and passionate and beautiful, and because I knew nothing about it. I enjoyed the constant challenge of it. I had to learn about f-stops and how to correctly wind lighting cables and how to calculate amps and volts so that I wouldn't set the living room on fire when I plugged in my 3-point lighting. I had to grow the balls to go knock on peoples doors and ask "could I use your garden for my film shoot?" Hardest of all, I had to collaborate with my classmates and choose teams of people who could actually get work done. And somehow, since I always seemed to end up in the director or producer role, I had to overcome my introversion and learn how to manage teams of people.</p><p>All through college, film kept scaring me, although I worked hard and got excellent grades. I was the first person to ever get into the major freshman year (accidentally - my advisor thought that I was a sophomore because of my AP credits, so he told me to submit a portfolio and I did). Senior year I got a grant from Gerry Abrams to produce my senior film. But unlike some of my classmates, I didn't work on film outside of class. I wasn't passionate about it like they were. It was just my education, and it was there to define me. "I am a film major," I could say at parties, and people would understand me and know exactly who I was. I could look up my course schedule online and know exactly what classes I had to take in order to graduate and become a film <em>maker. </em>Follow the coursework, and you'll end up with a job. That's what the teachers told us. Every now and then, an alumnus would come back from the real world to warn us that it didn't work like that.</p><p>Outside of class I actually had job. And I didn't realize it then, but this was a job that I loved. I had gotten it accidentally. My neighbor Daryl worked there, and in high school, when I had had my senior art show, he ended up buying one of my paintings and hiring me on as his helper. I was working on user experience research for government projects, which meant that I spent hours fooling around on a computer. It didn't feel like a job. I spent at least half of my time doing flash tutorials, making balls jump around the screen and rotate and change color. I even created my own paint program. I remember the thrill when I debugged it and it actually worked. "I am god," I thought to myself. My coworkers were amused, and they fed my interest by giving me books on user interaction and design patterns. I had no idea that you could go to school for this, or that I wanted to go to school for this. All I knew was that I loved it. I figured that if I kept working there, after I graduated maybe I could get a job there.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't keep my job there. Instead, I went to France for seven months (and accidentally ended up with a French Major and and International Studies Major), and when I got back they didn't need me anymore. So I went looking for another job and found a non-technical position at Penn State's computer help desk. I walked into the managers office, and asked about the position. "Non-technical position?" He asked. "We actually don't have any non-technical positions, only technical positions." I walked out. I was standing in the hallway when I heard him call to me, "Wait!"</p><p>I turned around. "Do you have <em>any</em> technical experience?"</p><p>"Er," I said, "I've done some flash programming."</p><p>"Flash programming? That's technical. You should apply!"</p><p>"Oh, ok." I said. So I applied to the technical position.</p><p>I was so nervous my first day of work that I was probably shaking. It didn't help that the girl I was shadowing accidentally deleted all of her client's email when trying to switch him from POP to IMAP. The client actually hung up the phone and came to the Help Desk in person to give her and my manager an earful as I cowered behind them.</p><p>After the first day, I found that I enjoyed the work. I was surprised to find that I was able to keep up with the other employees, most of whom were computer science majors or IST majors.</p><p>In October, my manager asked me to create a website for the help desk. "Could you have something by Monday?" He asked on a Friday. "Sure," I said. I'd never made a website in my life. I put my homework on hold and stayed up two nights working on the site. &nbsp;I &nbsp;sliced up a psd file and figured out how to make a working navigation and an RSS feed in HTML and CSS. It wasn't anywhere near standards compliant, and it probably would have validated as "crap" on the WC3's validation tool.&nbsp;I thought it was incredible. I showed it to my manager, who nodded and listed some changes that he wanted. "Could you actually make a Drupal site?" He asked. "I want to make something that I'll be able to update easily." I had no idea what Drupal was, but again I nodded.</p><p>And that's how I found my play. For me, it's that godlike feeling after you create a website, or a paint program in flash, or you figure out how to do a cool trick in bash. People always say that they're "not doing what they went to school for" as if it were a bad thing. I think that for me, it's a good thing. School was work, so I thought, as I had been taught by the adults around me, that if I was having fun I was doing it wrong. School taught me to turn fun things, like watching movies, into boring, pretentious things, like critiquing film.</p><p>Meanwhile, outside of school I learned to dance with my "work." I edited photos for fun in France. I started building websites as a hobby. I experimented with writing for student papers. I picked up InDesign.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing is work, but thinking makes it so.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Most Beautiful Person in the World</title>
      <link>/writing/166</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm sitting in a café, getting frustrated with writing some JavaScript on a website that I've been working on. Every time this happens I get angsty. "I can't program. I'm just a dumb artsy person. I should have stuck to painting." I start to feel self-pity. What if I had gone to school for computer science? I would be miles ahead of where I am now. I'm the worst JavaScripter in Seattle and I know it. One irrational angst leads to another. What if none of my plans work out? What if I can't get a boat? What if I never move up in the world and stay in the same job forever?
Suddenly the most beautiful person in the world walks in. She is about 5'2", maybe 25 years old, and has dyed red hair in a mullet and a spiky nose ring and two lip rings. She is wearing a hoody and ripped jeans. She is there with her date. He is a boy, about 14 years old, in a red raincoat that is too big for him. He walks trippingly and almost falls over himself as she guides him to his seat. "Do you want some tea?" she asks gently. Her voice is so gentle. He doesn't say anything. Instead, he puts his head down on the table and covers himself up with the big red sleeves of his red rain jacket. She pushes his tea toward him. He doesn't move.</p>
<p>"Do you want something else?" She asks. He still doesn't reply. "I'll get you something else." She gets up and goes to the counter and orders him a parfait. While she is there, he sits up with a mischievous smile on his face, and starts to laugh, a deep throaty laugh, as he drinks her tea. I'm laughing too. He puts his head back in his arms when she comes back.</p>
<p>"You <em>did</em> want tea," The most beautiful person in the world smiles. "I brought you a parfait. Do you want this?" Again, he doesn't move. "Do you want to see the fire?" She goes over and lights the gas fire in the back of the cafe. He looks up, attentive. He walks over to look at the fire, murmuring. She keeps talking to him. Slowly, he starts to talk back, mostly nonsense, sometimes laughter. He eats the parfait hungrily. I can't stop watching them. It looks like she is the babysitter, or the caretaker. But she genuinely cares for this boy.</p>
<p>I remember another night, a couple of days ago, when I was headed out dancing around 1am on Capital Hill. It was raining. A middle aged homeless woman was sitting in the dirt crying and a guy my age got off his bike to sit next to her. I couldn't stop staring. Usually in Seattle people shove homeless people out of the way, or else ignore them. But he was crouched in the dirt next to her, talking to her and she was nodding. He helped her to stand up. I couldn't stick around and watch, because I had to go dancing. Something about this scene sticks with me though. I have just come from a party of laughing, smiling, genuinely happy people wearing their finest clothes with their hair and makeup done to perfection. But here, in the mud on a street corner, I just saw the most beautiful person in the world.</p>
<p>In the cafe, I go back to the JavaScript problem. I forget my angst. I stop comparing myself to my friends. I think about the finished product - the kids who will be playing with this website when it is finished. Maybe someone like this 14 year old boy in the red rain jacket will enjoy playing with it. I catch his eye and smile. He laughs, covers his eyes, and turns away. Then he peeks back at me and I laugh too.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Boat Naming Contest</title>
      <link>/writing/172</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So that's it! I have my very own boat. I'll give more details in a bit. First things first though, I need a good name for her. And not just any name. I've decided that I want the name to be a computer science pun. For instance, a friend suggested "Sea++", "Sea#", or "C Shell." The dinghy also needs a name (preferably something that matches).
To up the stakes, the person who thinks of the best name for the sailboat or the dinghy gets to christen them at the boat christening party on August 4th.</p>
<p>To help you out, the boat is a 1974 29' Ericson with light blue trim and green sail covers. The sails are white and the spinnaker is blue and yellow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Maiden Voyage</title>
      <link>/writing/174</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I shook the owner’s hand. "Text me when you get to Seattle !" She said. "I’m excited for you guys!"
She pushed us off from the dock and threw me the bow line. The engine was warmed up, so with Andy on the tiller we backed up and started out on our journey.</p>
<p>Andy, John and I were headed from the marina of Port Angeles, Washington, to the Fremont Tug Boat Co on North Lake Union in Seattle. It was an 80 mile trip, and we had a chart of Puget Sound, several gallons of water, a cooler with turkey, crackers, chocolate and beer, and some other gear, including a propane tank and some ropes.</p>
<p>There were three of us. John was the most experienced sailor among us. He has a Laser and a 19-foot sailboat but he hasn’t done much distance sailing on larger boats. He had never dropped anchor or been through the locks. Nevertheless, I trusted him with my life. Andy is another useful person. He has experience fixing his jeep and he knows about motors and other mechanical things. He also is a lifeguard and has first aid and CPR certifications. He hasn’t really sailed since his sailing class sophomore year at Bainbridge High though.</p>
<p>And me? I’ve sailed my grandparents sunfish at their cottage a couple of times. I’ve ridden on my uncle’s sailboat on a tiny lake in Pennsylvania. In other words, I’m pretty much an expert. The first time I went to see my sailboat, the owner told me to take it out for a spin. I somehow managed to clear the slip. Then I ended up overstearing and doing a full 360 right in front of the fuel dock. A power boat drifting by joked to me, "Are you sure you have your boating license?" While attempting to dock the boat on the way back, I accidentally knocked the boat into neutral and almost drifted into another boat. Somehow (i.e. – with the help of a guy in a power boat who pulled me to the dock, and another sailor who grabbed my bow line and tied me up) I got the boat safely docked before the owner arrived. Naturally, I was confident that I could sail the boat 80 miles across open water.</p>
<p>The forecast told us that Saturday’s winds would be blowing at only 3 miles per hour, but thankfully they kept up at around 6. We were headed downwind, so John showed us how to jerry rig the jib open with a pole on port while the mainsail went out to starboard and keep the boat balanced directly in the center, thus catching more wind. We were flying across the sparkling sound, the dinghy tied to the back bouncing along the waves behind us. I turned the battery on and looked for a station on the radio. The only stations available were either arabic music or talk radio, so we settled for Arabic music and John and I bellydanced around the boat. The weather was sunny and perfect for sailing. Andy thought he saw an orca’s fin. He pointed it out and we kept watch until it surfaced again. There was definitely something there, whether orca or not I don’t know.</p>
<p>At 6pm we were still making good time. We’d passed Port Townsend and decided to cross over to Whidbey Island. Andy was asleep in the hold. The waves were getting choppier, and I asked John if I could take the tiller again. By now, the air was colder and I was dressed in long underwear, an underarmor shirt, and a complete set of rain gear, as well as a hat and sunglasses. The boat rolled in and out of the waves and I played with the tiller. There’s nothing like sailing a boat with the wind in the sails and the motion of the waves under the boat. And not just any boat. This was my boat and I was the captain. I was smiling ear to ear.</p>
<p>The sun was starting to set and the wind and waves were getting wilder. I had decided to anchor by the Keystone Ferry at Admirality Bay, since that looked like the most sheltered area on the map. The waves were pulling us toward Whidby Island, but the winds were pushing us in the opposite direction. Suddenly, the waves stopped and the ocean went almost surreally calm. The setting sun behind us cast a golden glow. We drifted along for a bit before I realized that this wind, or lack of wind, wasn’t going to get us to Admirality Bay by nightfall. "Maybe we should just anchor there," I said to John, pointing at the cliffs. "That looks somewhat sheltered."</p>
<p>I told John to get the anchor ready as we sailed in. There was a large anchor, two small ones, and a laundry basket full of rope – 200 feet of it. John sorted it out, took the jib down, and dropped the anchor. Just then, the waves picked up and the boat started to rock wildly again. Andy woke up and came out of the cabin rubbing his eyes. He exclaimed at the beauty of the setting sun, by now a ruby red sliver falling into a silver cloud. I didn't give him a chance to admire the spectacular sunset though, because I was nervous about being blown into the cliffs.</p>
<p>"Could you take down the mainsails? We just to dropped anchor."</p>
<p>Andy complied, sleepily fumbling with the ropes. I looked up to see the piece that goes in the top of the mainsail swinging in the wind. "Grab that!" I shouted.</p>
<p>"Grab what?"</p>
<p>"That!"</p>
<p>Andy looked up but it was too late. We’d lost the main halyard (the rope that pulls the mainsail up the mast). The boat was rocking back and forth in the waves and there was no way we could reach it. The boat also seemed to be being pulled by the tide toward the cliffs.</p>
<p>"This really isn’t a sheltered area," said Andy. We all agreed. I hadn’t wanted to use the motor at all, but it was almost dark and Admirality Bay was still a couple of miles away. Besides, the next morning we were somehow going to have to retrieve that piece.</p>
<p>We reached Admirality Bay after an hour or so of motoring in the dark and the cold. We passed the ferry dock and I found a spot behind what must have been an abandoned pier. I dropped the anchor from the bow, letting the chain and then the rope slip through my fingers. Finally, we were anchored and safe. We went below deck and started to prepare for bed.</p>
<p>I had taken my rain gear off and was shivering under a blanket, trying to get warm. John was peeing off the back of the boat when we heard him shout down to us : "Uh, guys...why are we not where we were? We’re really really far from where we were."</p>
<p>We ran up the stairs to to take a look. The boat had been pulled by the current, anchor and all, about 100 yards from where we had been. We were directly in the path of the ferry. The ferry was just appearing, a white dot on the horizon.</p>
<p>"What do you want to do?" John asked. "I suggest that we sail into the harbor."</p>
<p>I nodded in assent and Andy took the tiller. We started to head in. On the map, there looked like there might be a harbor entrance behind the ferry dock. Unfortunately, as we got closer we didn’t see any harbor entrance and realized that what looked like a harbor on the map was actually an enclosed lake with no entrance.</p>
<p>"Doesn’t look like there’s anything here." I said. "You should turn around."</p>
<p>"Too late!" Shouted Andy. The ferry was right behind us, a white monster with a blaring horn.</p>
<p>"Pull in here," John said, gesturing toward the boat ramp on the side of the ferry area.</p>
<p>We pulled out of the ferry’s way and spun the boat around. There was a boat ramp with a sort-of dock. John and I jumped off the boat and tied it to the dock. It wasn’t hard for us to make the decision to stay docked there for the night. There was a sign that said "30 minute docking only", but I figured that the coast guard would let us be for the night, especially since we were having some technical difficulties. Finally, finally we were able to go down to the cabin and get under the warm blanket. Out of harm’s way, it was actually quite funny. I started to doze off. Then I heard John’s voice again.</p>
<p>"Uh guys? I think the tide is going out and I can hear the keel scraping on the gravel."</p>
<p>Once again, we jumped up. This time I valiantly let the two men drag us a bit further down the dock into deeper water as I stayed below deck with the blanket wrapped around me. I checked my phone. It was midnight. I turned my phone off. The gentle creaks of the boat, the fenders hitting the dock, and the swoosh of the tide were the only sounds. Oh, and Andy and John snoring.</p>
<p>I was in the main v-berth, and I’d taken the canvas off of the skylight above me. Since we were out of the way of other boat traffic, I’d turned the anchor light off to save batteries, and the only light came from the moon. And the blue and red flashing of police lights. Police lights ? Oh no, the coast guard had come for us. I heard loud voices and footsteps on the dock and jumped up. "Don’t give me a parking ticket," I was thinking in my head. "Please don’t give me a parking ticket!" We pulled back the hatch and poked our heads up. There were two coast guard boats and a small motor boat. The motor boat was tying up on the other side of the dock, and two men in their fishing jackets were stomping around looking frustrated. From their conversation, we caught on that they had just been rescued. The coast guard motored away, and once again and for the last time I closed the cabin door and went back to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, John woke us up with an annoying morning person smile. I couldn’t be too angry at him though, because I was also somewhat of a happy annoying morning person this morning. I was a new boat owner, and thrilled to be alive on a foggy, chilly morning in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>I pulled Andy out of bed and we rummaged through the boat’s extra gear until we found the mast-climbing harness. John climbed the mast first and brought the main halyard down. Holding it, I saw what was wrong. The cleat didn’t close all the way, so when I’d rigged the mainsail I probably hadn’t gotten it all the way closed, and a couple of jerks from Andy taking the sail down had been enough to set it free. Thankfully, a quick squeeze from John’s leatherman fixed it. Unfortunately, John had brought the line down on the wrong side of the spreaders. We tried to tie it to another rope and pull it back up, but that didn’t work, so Andy climbed the mast and threw it down the correct side. It was fixed. There was a little cafe above the dock, and they turned the "open" sign on just then, so we went in and had some coffee and breakfast sandwiches. The power boaters from the night before were there too, and they told us their story. The motor had died and they’d been adrift, floating toward Port Townsend in the dark, so they’d had to call the Coast Guard to come rescue them. This morning they’d realized that the only problem with their engine was the ground to the battery, which had come loose. They’d fixed it themselves, after paying the coast guard $640 for a rescue.</p>
<p>The fog gradually rolled away as we sailed south toward Seattle. We arrived at the locks around 7pm. I was terribly nervous for this part, as I’d heard horror stories of ships coming untied and damaging other boats as the water rushed into the lock. Before the locks, there was a drawbridge. The sailboat ahead of us sailed in just fine, and the drawbridge opened up for it. It went down again before we arrived though, so we sailed in circles, confused as to why it wouldn’t open for us. A couple of power boats passed us. I was getting more and more nervous about us either running the mast into the bridge or hitting the wharves on either side. We couldn’t just spin in circles for forever. John suggested that maybe we needed to blow a horn. I thought maybe we needed to radio somebody. "No, I think we need an audible signal," John assured me, pointing to the sign that said we needed an audible signal. The sailboat and motor boats that had gone ahead had already entered the lock and were lining up. We were still on the wrong side of the drawbridge.</p>
<p>I tried making horn sounds with my mouth, but nothing happened. I went below deck and looked around for a bit. In a stroke of genius, I thought to look under the flares in the cupboard above the ice box. Sure enough, there was a funny looking kazoo-like metal instrument, a bit rusty but usable. John blew on it a couple times to blow the dust out. Then he took a deep breath and blew a loud "toot!" and just like that, the drawbridge opened. We went through and into the locks. It wasn’t difficult at all. We tied ropes around cleats on our port side, the gates closed behind us, and we and the three other boats in the lock gradually rose higher as the water slowly trickled in. Tourists all around us stared and pointed. We waved. It felt a bit like being in the zoo. The woman on the sailboat ahead of us gave the lock attendant a bag of chocolate coins. Then the gates on the other side opened and one by one we motored out into the brackish water of Lake Union. There were two more drawbridges before Fremont, so I got a chance to toot the horn a couple more times. Finally, we were home. Except that I’d never left home. Like a turtle, I’d carried my home with me for 80 miles. The sunset was red over the Seattle skyline, promising a beautiful morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Top 10 Reasons to Live on A Boat</title>
      <link>/writing/182</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I live on a boat. I have lived on a boat for four whole days. It's an unconventional adventure and I'm still figuring it out. I have no doubt that my decision to live on a boat is one of the best choices I have made so far in my life (ok, maybe that's not saying much, but baby steps, right?).
Anyway, here are my top 10 reasons for living on a boat:</p>
<p><strong>10. You can move anywhere in the world and never leave home</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Okay, so maybe this isn't true if you want to move to the Midwest and there's no lakes to dock your boat there. But you can move anywhere <strong>worthwhile</strong> and not have to leave home (I'm kidding. Sort of).</p>
<p><strong>9. You learn everything about boats</strong></p>
<p>What better way to learn about boats than to live on one? When you're constantly having to take care of the boat (because if you don't take care of it, you might drown in your sleep) you're constantly learning  skills that will come in handy if you ever go cruising, for example, or become a sea captain, or sail around the world, all of which I plan to do if I live long enough.</p>
<p><strong>8. You get really good at fixing things</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>...especially if you're on a limited budget.  On an older boat like mine, you have to learn a bit of marine wiring to make sure that your outlets keep working. You have to learn how to work an old-fashioned propane stove. You have to fix the finicky creature that is the boat toilet.</p>
<p>To use a geek metaphor, your apartment is Mac OS, where everything works as soon as you open it up and you don't really have to fiddle with anything, while living on a boat is Linux, where you're constantly tinkering and upgrading.</p>
<p><strong>7. You get rocked to sleep</strong></p>
<p>I love the feeling of being rocked to sleep. One thing I'm still getting used to is the fact that that rocking sensation stays with me for several hours after I get up. It's 10:30am, I've been off the boat for the past 4 hours, and I still feel like the world is rocking gently back and forth. Maybe it is rocking. Maybe the land is rocking, and the water is still. Hmmm....</p>
<p><strong>6. You wake up on a boat</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>This seems obvious, but it's amazing! There is no better way to start your day than crawling out of the v-berth, heating up some water for tea, and doing a bit of yoga on the dock as the sun rises.</p>
<p><strong>5. You can play "I'm on a Boat" constantly because it's always true.</strong></p>
<p>In fact, I have my alarm programmed to play "I'm on a Boat" every time I wake up.</p>
<p><strong>4. You have awesome neighbors</strong></p>
<p>People that choose to live on boats are fascinating, colorful people who have plenty of stories. There is also a solidarity between boat-dwellers that doesn't exist in, say, your average apartment complex.</p>
<p><strong>3. You become more mindful of what you waste</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>One of the main reasons I chose to live on a boat was to keep my life simple. I don't like having too many things. Having an uncluttered life helps me to have an uncluttered mind. Living on a boat certainly makes you re-evaluate what <em>things</em> are important to you. Also, you don't have room for a normal, American-sized trash can, so you don't buy cheap things that are going to break, and you only buy and throw away what you have to. When I bought the boat I made a resolution to make my boat a "trash-free" boat. Everything I buy must be either in recyclable or compostable packaging. I don't buy much, but even so, this is proving to be a challenge.</p>
<p>You also pay attention to the water that you waste. You can't use harsh cleaning products, because everything you put on your boat gets washed directly through holes in the floor into the lake that you live on. Instead, to clean my boat I use water from the lake and a lot of "elbow grease."</p>
<p><strong>2. You don't have to clean the bathroom</strong></p>
<p>I'm lucky - I live in a small, family-owned marina and there is a small bathroom that only a handful of people use. It is always spotless. It's nice to have one less thing to think about.</p>
<p><strong>1. It's the best place to be in the Zombie Apocalypse
</strong></p>
<p>...hands down. You know <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>? How did they escape? On a boat. You know <em>Day of the Dead</em>? How did they die? They got off the boat. When the Zombie Apocalypse comes, I will try to save everybody like the hero that I am, but unfortunately that will not be possible. Instead, I will only be able to 8 of my friends on my boat. I really hope you make the cut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle Startup Weekend - Women's Edition</title>
      <link>/writing/189</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had the privilege of attending Seattle Startup Weekend’s first woman focused event this past weekend. I say priviledge because there was a waitlist of over 100 women who weren’t able to come, in addition to the ~70 who did. I like to think that I helped to contribute to this wait list, since I did my best to promote the event to any design, technical, or business minded women whom I know. Unfortunately, I don’t know many. Actually that should be in past tense, because now I can say that I know quite a few.
I expected the weekend to have a different feel to it from the mostly male startup weekend that I attended in April. Startup Weekend Women’s Edition had a ratio of men to women that was roughly the inverse of an average Startup Weekend. So how different was it to attend a startup even that was 75% women? Honestly, there was no difference. There was still that tangible energy. The sense of complete and utter focus and the do or die mentality was electric. It was fun!</p>
<p>And why would it be different? It’s not like we spent the weekend talking about our uteri. We spent it pumping out code, crafting business models, and doing market research. My team and I stayed up until 4am Saturday night working on our project. The only differences I noticed were that there were more macbooks, the food served was veggies and wine (as opposed to beer and pizza) and the t-shirts actually fit.</p>
<p>While I had a blast at the mostly male startup weekend in May and made some great connections, I think that women’s edition of startup weekend had greater benefits for me. In any realm, from sports to business to technology, men are too quick to offer help and often end up overshadowing the women who meekly accept their help. Oftentimes it seems like men, especially older men, assume that they know more just because they’re men. And I think that many women have been conditioned to assume that they know less or aren’t as skillful, which makes them vulnerable to accepting a guy’s help. It was good to be an environment of mostly women, where no guy was going to pop over and suggest that I follow his lead or ask me to give him my code for him to "fix" it. I'll probably delve more into this topic in a later blog post.</p>
<p>I look forward to staying connected with all of the incredible women I met this weekend. Also, if you were a woman who attended Seattle Startup Weekend and we didn’t get a chance to connect, or if you’re a woman who would be interested in attending a startup weekend and wants to know more, feel free to comment or reach out. I’d love to get to know more startup women!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Give a Lot When You Don't Have Much</title>
      <link>/writing/194</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a trip through Italy I remember going on a walk and ending up chatting in pidgin Italian with a fruit vendor. I didn’t have any cash with me, but she handed me a pear anyway. I protested that I couldn’t pay for it. She smiled at me and said, “giving costs nothing but it is the best reward.” At first I thought I had misunderstood her. “Giving costs nothing?” If she hadn’t given me the pear, she could have sold it. There was an obvious economic cost, and I found myself doubting her business sense. And yet, I remembered her and thought about what she’d said (and the sweet taste of the pear).
Giving back sure feels good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>I may be a bitter young cynic, but I can still appreciate the joy of giving, and I admire those who give. So how do you give back when your salary barely covers the necessities?</p>
<ol>
<li>Give what you have.</li>
</ol>
<p>Chances are that you have extra stuff lying around, taking up closet space. You don’t have to send your stuff to a developing country for it to make an impact (in fact, some make a strong case for overseas aid ruining the economy of developing countries). Make an account on <a href="http://www.freecycle.org/">Freecycle</a>, and give it away there. I had some extra kids lifejackets when I bought my boat, and I listed them on freecycle, and within 10 minutes I had five people asking if they could take them. No matter how little you have, chances are that you have something extra that somebody else could use, whether it be a cardboard box or an old towel.</p>
<p>2. Give your time.</p>
<p>Time is money, so it’s understandable that you feel like you can’t afford to give your time. However, if you find yourself wasting time in front of the computer or television, consider giving your time to charity instead. There are many groups, such as the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/volunteerism-155/">Seattle Volunteers Meetup</a> (for those in Seattle), that give you a great social outlet while at the same time providing you a rewarding opportunity to give to others. You don’t even have to commit to doing it regularly – you can instead choose to go out every now and then for a key event that really matters to you, such as cleaning up the parks on Earth Day. And if the reward of giving in itself wasn’t enough, you can volunteer in a field where you are trying to build a portfolio, such as volunteering to build a website for a non-profit.</p>
<p>3.  Give your home</p>
<p>I have some awesome travel stories, thanks to the amazing people who have hosted me around the world. Without these hosts, I would never have had the chance to travel and see what I did. In Argentina, I lived with three wonderful families who put up with me for four months each. To me they are still "familia."</p>
<p>If you have the space and time, you could consider becoming a host parent for an exchange student. If all you have is a very tiny boat, like me, you can consider becoming a host for <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/">couchsurfers</a>. Some amazing people hosted me when I was doing a bike trip across France. I just hosted my first couchsurfer, Rebekka from Germany. It was her first time in the states and her excitement about being here rubbed off on me. It’s cool to be able to see the place you live through the eyes of a stranger. (Disclaimer: This is pretty much common sense, but here are tons of weirdoes in the world and you should be choosy about whom you host. Make sure that they have plenty of recommendations and a fully filled out profile, and if they give you the creeps when you meet them in person, don’t feel bad about reneging on your couch hosting offer).</p>
<p>4. Give your knowledge</p>
<p>Chances are that you have more than just time to give. You might even have some knowledge! There’s even a chance that somebody else wants to learn some of the knowledge that you have. In the age of the Internet, there’s a ton of ways to give your knowledge. For instance, you could contribute to Wikipedia or an opensource project. You could submit a recipe to <a href="http://allrecipes.com/">allrecipes.com</a> or a similar site. Or you could contribute your expertise on a forum that interests you. Then again, you could go old-fashioned and offer to teach or tutor face-to-face.</p>
<p>5. Give your positive energy</p>
<p>Okay, so you don't have time to host a guest, you have nothing to donate, and you frankly just aren't a giver. What to do? You can give yourself simply by being yourself. Have you ever had a stranger smile at you and that kept you smiling the rest of the day? Or have you ever interacted with somebody who asked you how you were doing and really meant it? Rather than being a martyr and giving everything away, try being selfish and focusing on your own happiness. Rather than spreading yourself thin by trying to give to much, forge sincere relationships with people. Once you are happy yourself you’ll probably make a lot more people happy. Who knew giving could be so selfish? Apparently giving really does cost nothing.</p>

      <title>The Hippie Hacker</title>
      <link>/writing/197</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chris McClimans is tall but soft-spoken and his hair cascades over his shoulder in a tangle of thick, dirty-blond dreadlocks. He wears sandals he made himself from a piece of rubber and twine, and he carries a bulging backpack at all times. It’s not hard to believe that this man once lived in a green Volkswagon van in Austin and Boulder, or that he spent the past several years travelling around New Zealand with his now wife.
It wouldn’t be hard to believe, either, that he is couchsurfing around Seattle at the moment, living out of said backpack as he looks for work.</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is what he has in his backpack. I had the odd coincidence of running into him three days in a row at three separate technology events. Monday I ran into him at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Seattle-Ruby-on-Rails-Developers-Meetup-Group">Ruby on Rails Meetup</a> at the Racer Café. Tuesday he was at the monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/HackerNewsSeattleMeetup/">Hacker News Meetup</a>, where I convinced him to come to my <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Arduino/Seattle-WA/765462/">arduino meetup</a> the following night. That’s when I finally got to see what exactly he carried with him in his bag.</p>
<p>After the meetup we gathered round as Chris pulled several pieces of magic out of the mysterious black backpack. Item number one was an ergonomic keyboard that he typed on in Dvorak. He is clearly a man who uses his keyboard a lot and loves comfort and efficiency.</p>
<p>Items two, three and four were laptops, each one covered in some of the coolest coder stickers I’ve ever seen.  You can’t always judge a man by the stickers on his laptop (for example, my laptop proudly wears a GitHub sticker while my <a href="https://github.com/zebular13">GitHub account</a> remains sadly barren) but I think it’s safe to believe that every sticker on Chris’s machines represented a part of his deep knowledge of computers.</p>
<p>Item number five was a small USB stick.</p>
<p>This stick of memory was the magic wand from which Chris could deploy his own creation, <a href="http://www.instantinfrastructure.org/">Instant Infrastructure (:ii)</a>, to the whole world. He demonstrated for us on his laptop. After plugging in his USB stick he ‘factory reset’ the operating system from the stick itself. The purple background blossomed on his computer, followed by the familiar Ubuntu icons.</p>
<p>Now, he explained to us, he could use Ubuntu ‘out of box experience’ (OOBE) to image his computer with the selection of open source software that he needed. For instance, if he were a doctor he could simply select the ‘doctor’ software package and it would automatically image his computer with all the tools he needed. Or if he were a teacher he could similarly image his computer with tools for teaching. Of course, the stick depends on the availability of free software that can be deployed on the computer. Chris has already demonstrated his idea to people at Dell who are coming up with a tool to share software via a Git Repositor (if you don’t know what that is, it’s basically ‘the cloud’) called '<a href="http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/campaigns/sputnik">Sputnik</a>.' More than anything, Chris said, he needed developers willing to volunteer their time to create free software.</p>
<p>I invited Chris to couchsurf on my boat that weekend. Although I was in and out, dancing all night Friday at a Kaskade concert and then dancing in the viral video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvNhsWMU0c">We’re Nasa and We Know It</a> on Sunday, Chris and I got a brief chance to talk Saturday morning. We were munching on blueberries he brought home from the farmer’s market and sunning ourselves on the deck of my boat. I asked him how he’d come up with the idea for Instant Infrastructure and he told me about Cambodia. He spends about 60% of his time volunteering for charity and 40% working to make money.</p>
<p>He spent 6 months in Battambang, Cambodia, where he taught local youth about computers. He realized that the kids there wanted to be like him. They wanted to have his fancy macbook pro and use the expensive software packages that he did. He also realized that they would probably never be able to afford to do this. Determined to bridge the technology gap, he developed Instant Infrastructure to be deployed on the cheap Windows machines in the local internet cafes. Using Ubuntu , the kids were able to master computer skills, and have even developed a site in their own language, Kmer, titled ‘<a href="http://htoe.webs.com/">Humanity to Everyone</a>.’</p>
<p>Chris’s passion and his giving spirit were evident as he talked about the kids he’d taught.  I feel honored to have had a chance to host the ‘Hippie Hacker’ in his travels in the Northwest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to be an Adult Part 1</title>
      <link>/writing/20</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think that there are a lot of things that nobody tells you about being an adult that you don't learn in college.
I tried googling "how to be an adult" and there really wasn't much information. It's a topic that's been on my mind for a while now, so I sat down with some friends and came up with a list of how to be an adult. This is the list of things you do when you're an adult:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip well and even when it’s not expected (and no less than $2)</li>
<li>Be able to choose a wine at dinner (actually, if this is true most people aren’t adults)</li>
<li>Be resourceful enough to navigate a city by yourself and not freak out</li>
<li>Always pay for yourself. Have enough in your bank account every time.</li>
<li>Pay on time.</li>
<li>Have something edible or drinkable in your abode in case guests come over</li>
<li>Know how to take care of your vehicle (boat, car, bike?)</li>
<ul>
<li>change your tires.</li>
<li>change your oil.</li>
<li>register your vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<li>Know your rights and be civically active (vote!)</li>
<li>Give back to the community somehow</li>
<li>Go to the doctor's for a checkup at least once a year.</li>
</ul>
<div>Then I realized that being an adult is more about the little things than the big things.  So I wrote up a list of little things that adults have to do that kids and college students usually don't think about.</div>
<ul>
<li>Little things like:</li>
<ul>
<li>change your sheets once every two weeks</li>
<li>change your razor heads</li>
<li>brush your teeth</li>
<li>change your underpants</li>
<li>wear underpants</li>
<li>separate the lights and the darks when you do laundry</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This list is far from comprehensive, so I'd appreciate your input. In fact, why not have an essay contest? I'll include the details in an upcoming post so stay tuned!</p>

      <title>The Future is Here: DIY 3D Printing</title>
      <link>/writing/204</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I watched as a coil of white plastic was pulled off of a spool into the plywood frame, forced into a metal head, and squeezed out, partially melted, onto a the smooth metal surface that moved in precise circles. Layer after layer of thin melted plastic slowly gave shape to a round object.  When it was finished, the Makerbot Vulcan pushed the round object out onto the table, where it landed with a soft bounce. I picked it up and slid it on. It stretched over my hand and slipped on like a bracelet, my first piece of 3D printed jewelry.
I was at the 3D printer Survey hosted by <a href="http://studentrnd.org/">StudentRND</a>. I’d sent a link to my coworker Scott the week before about how 3D printing is changing our economy. Scott, who hadn’t realized how far 3D technology has progressed in the past year, immediately caught the bug. We started talking about chipping in to buy a 3D printer together. The 3D Printer Survey looked like the perfect chance to experience consumer level 3D printers and possibly make a decision on which 3D printer we wanted to buy.</p>
<p>At the survey, Craig Zupke presented a useful prezi titled ‘<a href="http://prezi.com/tj7hhoydn5xr/3d-printer-survey/">Your Path To a 3D printer</a>.’ He talked about the inverse relationship of price to maintenance. Basically, you can get a 3D printer for $500 if you’re willing to build it from scratch and maintain it yourself. Otherwise, plan on shelling out $12-$15K. One of the things that makes these printers more affordable is that they are self-replicating. Once you have one, you can print out up to 80% of the parts for another one.</p>
<p><a href="http://reprap.org/">Reprap.org</a> is the main site for self-replicating 3D printers. The first self-replicating 3D printer came out in 2008, and since then growth has been exponential, as makers modify and improve on the open-source designs.</p>
<p>Currently, there are only a handful of 3D printers available at consumer price-points. The <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/">Makerbot printer</a> is probably the most famous. Emmett, creator of the famous ‘gear-heart’ design, showed us his two printers, the Vulcan and the Venus. The Vulcan was one of the very first 3D printers, and it prints its own upgrades. The automated build platform was one of the upgrades, and it makes it easy to mass-print 3D parts. Emmett was mass-printing bracelets as we watched.</p>
<p>The Venus is a newer printer, and Emmett showed us how it could print 2 different colors of plastic at once, making multicolored objects. The precision and level of detail was impressive.</p>
<p>Another person had brought his Makerbot replicator. It’s similar to the Venus, and he praised the easy setup and ease of calibration. He also gave us a pro-tip: don’t use ALS plastic, use PLA. The plastic used in DIY 3D printers comes in a spool of thin tubing. ALS is the smelly, non-natural plastic that is used frequently in toy-making. PLA is a biodegradable, odorless plastic that needs less heat and does less wear and tear on the 3D printer.</p>
<p>Craig’s printer was a <a href="http://mendelmax.com/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=MendelMax">MendelMax</a> and Craig had built it himself. He showed us some cool 3D models that he had created by scanning himself and his daughter using a sensor bar hooked up to his Nintendo (I think? I know you can also do this by using a Wiimote with Autodesk.)</p>
<p>Another woman showed off her <a href="http://www.ultimaker.com/">Ultimaker</a> printer. The objects that she showed us had an incredible level of detail, much finer than any of the other objects we’d seen printed on the other printers. Unfortunately, she told us, she couldn’t recommend Ultimaker as a company. Some of her parts didn’t work when the printer was first shipped, and they hadn’t given her a free replacement. Also, they are based in the Netherlands and are slightly pricier than most US based DIY printers.</p>
<p>Finally, Johann showed off his Rostock Printer. It literally is DIY – Johann designed and built it himself. He offers the plans for free at <a href="http://thingiverse.com/thing:17175">thingiverse.com/thing:17175</a> or <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Rostock">reprap.org/wiki/Rostock</a>.</p>
<p>He explained to us that the Rostock is named after the town he grew up in in Northern Germany. Johann was printing out parts for the second generation Rostock printer as we talked to him. He held up what he had built so far on the second version, a light-weight frame made of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ttstam/openbeam-an-open-source-miniature-construction-sys">openbeam </a>and printed plastic parts.</p>
<p>The first-generation Rostock was fast and worked beautifully. It can print objects as large as 12x14 inches and is incredibly sturdy and accurate. Unlike most of the other 3D printers that we’d seen, the engines, wiring, and arduino that power the whole thing are aesthetically tucked out of sight below the printer. All the parts, Johann told us, could be bought for $500. Scott and I were both impressed. We’re not buying a 3D printer yet, but I know that I’ll definitely be attending the next 3D printer Survey.</p>

      <title>Foul Weather Bluff</title>
      <link>/writing/209</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I woke up on Saturday at 6am. No, that’s a lie. I reset my alarm to 6:15…then 6:30…then finally 6:45. Not that I wasn’t excited for the race – it was just that it was Saturday.
Now it was almost too late. I rushed to find my clothes. Layers, Shayne had said. Wool socks, wool pants, wool shirt. Sweater. Sweatshirt. Foulies. Keens. Lifejacket? Check. I was ready to go. Shayne was here to pick me up.</p>
<p>The sun was rising, glinting off a forest of silver masts as we pulled up to the Edmonds marina. People were milling about, carrying things on and off sailboats. What beautiful boats! No two were even remotely the same. “This is Wagz.” Shayne was introducing me to someone. “And Wayne.” I shook their hands. “It’s a pleasure.” Then we were ushered into the yacht club’s meeting room for the skipper’s meeting, where the race was explained. I drank a cup of coffee and stared around me at the hundreds of sailors. I didn't bother paying attention to the race details. Not my job.</p>
<p>The boat, Bravo Zulu, motored into the harbor and swung around, nestling up to the fuel dock. I grabbed a line that was passed to me – it was soft and thick and new. A wiry man with a hoarse voice told me to wrap it around the cleat once before I did the figure 8. I followed his instructions.</p>
<p>“I’m Peter,” he said, shaking my hand. Clearly he was the one in charge.</p>
<p>I picked up a brush and followed Wayne around the boat, scrubbing the decks glistening white as he sprayed them with the hose. A few final preparations, as short speech from Peter, a few more introductions to the rest of the crew, and we were off, motoring after the fleet into the sound. Around us, sails were going up. Gold and black, they billowed outwards as the boats turned into the wind one by one and winched their sails to the top of the mast. A beautifully painted catamaran skimmed past us. “That’s the dragonfly. She wins every race,” Wagz said.</p>
<p>We sailed in circles, waiting for our turn to race. Every five minutes, the committee boat blew a horn and another set of boats took off. Five minutes to go. I was positioned on the windward side where they had told me to lie down. Code 0, the asymmetrical spinnaker used for light wind, was on the foredeck, ready to go. Denny, the boat’s owner, was talking to Peter. They were watching the boats in the classes ahead of us to see which sails they were using.</p>
<p>One minute to go. I tried to move my body off any lines that I might be holding down. “If you’re sitting on one of the lines, they’ll yell butt-cleat,” Shayne told me.</p>
<p>The horn blew. We were off. I heard a commotion on the leeward side of the boat. Peter was yelling, “Stand down. Barging at the line. Barging I tell you!”</p>
<p>“That’s it. They’re doing a penalty. They were barging.”  The “Absolutely”, a black and yellow boat in our class, had had to sail around as a penalty for barging. Our start had been perfect.</p>
<p>We zipped ahead with the full spinnaker. 6 knots and climbing. I waited, attentive, for them to yell “squirrel.” Squirrel was my task – to stand in the “sewer” and fold spinnakers as they were handed down to me. There were 5 different spinnakers and a drifter. There were also 2 different jibs, but it looked like for now we would only be using the jib for light wind. My other job was rail-meet. Basically, I had to use my weight to either weigh down the leeward side of the boat when we were going slowly and trying to fill the sails with wind, or to counterbalance the windward side of the boat when we started to speed up and the boat keeled over from the wind’s pressure. The force of the wind is an amazing thing. Even in the light winds and fair weather the 40 foot, 12,000 lb Bravo Zulu was being pushed fast enough to leave a wake.</p>
<p>We reached Bainbridge Island just behind Absolutely. A cluster of fishermen at the point were standing waist deep in water. ‘Don’t turn yet,’ Denny told Peter. The rest of the crew looked skeptical as we flew towards the shallow water at the point. We sailed within throwing distance of the waist deep fishermen without touching the bottom, saving time by not gybing. Now we seemed to be ahead of the Absolutely. The mark was just ahead, at Foul Weather Bluff. But the currents came into play again. We were caught in a bad breeze and even though we had been closer to the mark, Absolutely managed to round it before us. “Squirrel!”</p>
<p>They had yelled for me. I rushed below and grabbed the n.1 spinnaker. I heaved it to the deck.</p>
<p>Then I hurried below again to gather and fold the code 0.</p>
<p>As the ships rounded the mark they flew their colorful symmetrical spinnakers for the downwind leg. It was beautiful to watch them go up, like hot air ballons, puffing to full size, full of powerful wind.</p>
<p>The downwind leg soon became painfully slow. The Puget Sound currents were pushing outwards, and several boats with full spinnakers appeared to be standing still, pushed in one direction by the wind and the other by the tide. I was lying on deck again, weighing down the leeward side. It seemed like a good time for a nap, since I was on the sunny side of the deck. I closed my eyes and slept for a good twenty minutes. When I woke up we didn’t seem to be much further. There was one more marker to go around before we could head back. It was on the south side of Whidbey Island. Two fat seals and three slender cormorants had decided to use it as their personal platform. The seals slid into the water as we rounded the marker, splashing their fat into the waves. We didn’t have to take the spinnaker down, as we were still headed downwind. Denny, Peter and the crew were discussing again. The water in the direction of the finish line was too smooth, too calm. One boat had been ahead but seemed to be stuck in the calm water to the north of the finish line. We decided to sail south of the finish line, then tack north to avoid the windless section of water.</p>
<p>We were moving again, faster. I went up and down, fetching the jib and the code 0 in case we needed them again. We didn’t. We finished with the symmetrical spinnaker number one. As we passed the committee boat, they blew the air horn. No pistol for us – we hadn’t been first in our class. Absolutely had taken first.</p>
<p>We had been sailing for 8 long hours and covered 26 miles. It had been a slow race, but the unusually perfect weather had made it enjoyable and relaxing. Next time we'll hopefully have stronger winds...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Living on a Boat in the Winter</title>
      <link>/writing/214</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I tell people that I live on a boat, they invariably ask me if I've lived on it over winter yet. And so far I've just shrugged and told them that no, I bought the boat in July and I'm still waiting to experience my first winter. Until now.
"Looks like it decided to be winter," said the woman at the bus stop on Thursday morning. It was true. The sun no longer reaches it's zenith. Instead, it gets above the tree tops around noon and then immediately decides it's time to head back down. The wooden dock ices over in the morning and I have to be careful not to slip off as I wheel my bike to the gate.</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning has been getting harder and harder as it gets darker and rainier and colder. Going to bed is also difficult. I have two space heaters, but for safety reasons I don't leave them on while I'm gone. When I get home from work (and other evening activities - so usually I get home pretty late) the first thing I do is turn the heaters on and close the boat up as I jog to the marina bathrooms for a hot shower. By the time I've run the hundred feet along the icy dock to keep my wet hair from freezing the boat is warm. But when I crawl into bed, the covers are still chilly.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I went to lunch with some friends of my friend Shayne, a couple name Alex and Christine. They have lived on a boat for a while and they gave me some expert advice. "Buy an electric blanket and a dehumidifier." Christine also suggested opening storage areas when I'm not there to let them air out.</p>
<p>I took their sage advice (they're both world class sailors and know a thing or two about boats) and bought an electric blanket. I also ordered some dehumidifiers from amazon to place in my storage compartment. Although my boat doesn't leak (it did have two very tiny leaks on the deck but I filled them with epoxy and that seems to have done the trick) it does condense on the inside in the winter, which can lead to mold or mildew, especially in closed storage areas. I found a couple of wireless silicone dehumidifiers to place in the storage areas and hopefully that will solve the moisture problem. Other than that, the boat is totally cozy and I'm happy to living there, even on a cold November morning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Teach Yourself Web Development</title>
      <link>/writing/217</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple months ago, my Mom mentioned that she was considering taking some web development courses. That gave me the idea to collect a list of free resources that I used to teach myself web development.
The other week I attended<a href="http://www.igniteseattle.com/"> Ignite Seattle</a> and had the chance to watch and excellent five-minute talk entitled "The Art of Explanation" by <a href="http://artofexplanation.com/">Lee LeFever.</a> In it, he mentioned the "curse of knowledge" and how it makes explaining difficult because we can't relate to our audience. Thankfully, I don't have the curse of knowledge. I've learned everything I'll be writing about web development over the past two years, and much of what I'll be teaching I'll be learning or relearning as I write about it.</p>
<p>I have a rough format in mind, and if you've ever wanted to teach yourself web development or just become more web savvy I'd encourage you to follow along. I'll assume that you've never done any web development.</p>
<p>So let's get started! The first thing that you should do is sign up for an account on "<a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy.com</a>." We're going to go over HTML basics. HTML is basically the skeleton of the internet. Most of the text you look at online uses HTML. I'll talk more about codeacademy and other resources for learning HTML in my next post. Cheers!</p>

      <title>Beginning CSS (for free!)</title>
      <link>/writing/224</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hopefully you've finished a couple of HTML tutorials on Codeacademy by now and you're on your way to becoming an HTML expert. Maybe you've already built a social media profile (HTML Basics II) or a clickable photo page (HTML Basics III). Now it's time to get into CSS.
What is CSS? CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets," although knowing that probably won't help you much. The best way to understand CSS is to head over to <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>. As you can see, there are thousands of different themes for this website. Try clicking on a few. The only things that change are the layout, color, and style. All of the text and the basic format stay the same because the HTML hasn't changed. CSS is what determines most of how the page looks. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin.</p>
<p>CSS Zen Garden has a link to a great collection of CSS resources right here: <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources/" target="_blank">http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/resources</a></p>
<p>Although they only accept the best designs, getting your theme accepted to Zen Garden is something to work towards. First off though, we want to style our own website.</p>
<p>There are already several CSS courses on Codacademy. It's probably a good idea to start off with the three CSS courses in the Web Fundamentals Section.</p>
<p>After that, you can move on to this course: <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/create-a-personal-webpage/0#!/exercises/0" target="_blank">http://www.codecademy.com/courses/create-a-personal-webpage/0#!/exercises/0</a></p>
<p>Wow, that was easy! You can already build a nice looking web page!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>To Flip Flop or not? A UX question</title>
      <link>/writing/flipflopbuttons</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I'm cat-sitting for friends who are in Hawaii. The first night I got to the house, I couldn't figure out how to turn the lights on in the kitchen. Each light switch had a rectangular panel that was either glowing or off. I figured that the glowing switches corresponded to the lights that were currently on, and the not glowing switches corresponded to the lights that were currently off.</p>
  
      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/56d91f379f726613800bf967/1457069930553/monica.s.houston%40gmail.com.houston%40gmail.com?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p> </p><p>Of course I was wrong, and ended up turning all of the lights up and standing in the dark. Standing there in the dar, the design finally made sense to me - of course the lights that are turned off have glowing switches - that's so that you can find the switch in the dark! The switches indicate what you want the light to do (turn on), not what it is currently doing. I ran into a similar problem two months ago while doing UX for a Windows Phone 8 App. It was a GPX tracker and it had 4 buttons in the Application Bar: a , a navigation button, a stats button, play/pause/stop recording button, and a settings button. The play/pause/stop recording button turned out to be the one that caused the problems.</p><p>After looking at other apps with "play/pause" buttons I realized that in every single one, when you are "playing" the play button is a pause button, and when you are paused, the button turns into the play button. In User Interaction speak, these are called "flip/flop buttons."&nbsp;This brings up an interesting question: should the label on the button define the action you want to perform pushing it or the state that that button represents?</p><p>Besides play/pause buttons, I can only think of a few other flip/flop buttons that I regularly encounter. One would be the TweetDeck "follow" vs "unfollow" button (the button on the normal Twitter interface when you are following someone reads "following" and only says "unfollow" if you hover over it.) In fact, an extremely commonly used binary setting,</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="272.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/56d91fa1f850821330663975/1457069988194/monica.s.houston%40gmail.com.houston%40gmail.com?format=original" alt="ok, it's in French but you know what it means..."/> ok, it's in French but you know what it means...[/caption] 
  

<p> </p><p>In the UI for "GPX Viewer" I decided to go the route of consistency. Because the play/pause buttons had to show the action you wanted to perform when pushing it, all of the other buttons in the AppBar would have to follow the same rule to avoid confusion. I still felt somewhat uncomfortable with this solution.</p><p>In <em><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0764526413">About Face 2.0</a>,</em>&nbsp;Cooper and Reimann (2003, pp. 341-2), arguably the experts on Interaction Design, say</p><blockquote><p>"Flip-flop button controls are very efficient. They save space by controlling two mutually exclusive options with a single control. The problem with flip-flop controls is that they fail to fulfill the second duty of every control - to inform the user of their current state. If the button says ON when the state is off, it is unclear what the setting is. If it is OFF when the state is off, however, where is the ON button? Don't use them. Not on buttons and no on menus!"</p></blockquote><p>So was I wrong to use flip/flop buttons in the AppBar? The exception, as stated by Cooper and Reimann on page 445, is when the current state is obvious. For instance, if you have one minimize/mazimize button on your browser window, when the current state is maximize the button should read "minimize" because it's clear that the browser is already maximized.&nbsp;</p><p>After user testing for 3 years (the app is in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/gpx-viewer/9nblggh080t1">Windows Phone app store</a>), I've received nothing but positive feedback. I take this to mean that I made the correct choice.&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Stop Thinking About Doing Things. Do Things.</title>
      <link>/writing/243</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about updating my website for a while. I haven't touched it since last year and it looks childish (I think) and doesn't represent my work. Every time I send it to someone I have to include a disclaimer about how outdated it is.
So I decided to upgrade. With enough free time, enough motivation, and enough caffeine that seems like a simple task. But somehow, three months have passed and nothing has happened. Why haven't I gotten anything done?</p>
<p>I realized that it came down to the fact that I was thinking about it too much. These are some samples of actual thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I need to sit down and sketch out every interaction before I write a line of code because this is going to be the best damn vanity site in the whole world."</li>
<li>"Even though updating my website is important for my career, other things might be a priority right now so I should make a list of priorities before I start it to make sure that it's really a priority."</li>
<li>"I have to read every book on UI Design <em>ever</em> before I can make a website that's good enough."</li>
</ul>
<p>But the more I plan my site, the less I actually want to make it. If it's taken me six months to just<em> think</em> about upgrading it, how long will it take to actually do it?</p>
<p>There are a lot of things like my website that I never finish, or even start, because of over-thinking.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I should probably go running, but there might be a more efficient way to get fit, so I'm going to browse the internet until I figure out what it is."</li>
<li>"I want to go on a two week bike trip, but what if there is a really great opportunity that I miss because I was away biking?"</li>
<li>"I should use twitter to market myself, but I don't know what message I want to send about myself so I'm going to go to the library and get  out 15 books on personal branding and read each of them halfway through and do five of the self help exercises and learn nothing."</li>
<li>"I really like so and so. I should go out with him because it would be fun. But what if he falls in love and I don't like him and we have to break up and...? I think I'll stay in tonight and look at pictures of cats on the internet."</li>
</ul>
<p>My draft box is filled with emails I never sent because I spent so long trying to word them perfectly that I gave up. Before I do things I think about the consequences 5 years in the future. I worry that I'll invest effort in something and not have the reward that I expected. What if I do it and it's not perfect? What if there's a more efficient way to do it?</p>
<p>There are four things that get me out my over-thinking rut:</p>
<ol>
<li>Desperation - I do it because I have nothing left to lose</li>
<li>Competition - I do it because I want to one-up you (this can backfire if I spend too much time thinking about how to be perfect)</li>
<li>Curiosity - I do it because I want to know what happens if I do it</li>
</ol>
<p>And sometimes, like today, I just get sick of not getting anything done and the new smell of spring inspires me to do something, like write a blog post.</p>
<p>It's hard, but it's worth it. I find that I'm a lot happier when I stop thinking about things and just do them. It doesn't matter that I can't do everything as long as I can do something. It doesn't matter that I can't do something perfectly as long as I can do it at all.</p>
<p>So I'm going to stop re-reading this, I'm not going to scour the internet to make sure that this exact same post hasn't been written before (I'm sure it has but who cares), I'm going to stop editing this and I'm going to press "Publish."</p>
<p>And then I'm going to update my website.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My First Swiftsure</title>
      <link>/writing/250</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Saturdy May 25th - Day One of the Race</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: left;">The 70th annual Swiftsure Regatta began on Saturday, May 25th, 2013 in Victoria, Canada. Boat call was 6:30am but I got there a little early to put breakfast in the oven. I'm not a very good sailor so I try to make myself useful in other ways. I sail on a 40.7 Benneteau named Bravo Zulu. Her crew is usually between 8 and 12 people. For this race we had 11 - our skipper Denny, Steve, the navigator and tactician, Christa and Erica who do bow, Brenda, who is both a trimmer and our boat's M.D., Shayne, Wayne, Kerry and Leif who are usually in the cockpit either trimming or grinding (and sometimes skippering), and Taylor, a new addition to the crew who can do everything well. Then there is myself - resident rail meat and squirrel extraordinaire. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had come up on Thursday on a 53ft boat named Artemis after missing the Bravo Zulu delivery and had spent the past day and a half hanging out in Victoria Harbor, checking out the other boats, including the HMCS Oriole, a beautiful wooden Canadian Navy ship with twin tree trunks for masts that was going to do the in shore course.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At 8am an alarm sounded. All of the glistening boats untied and motored out into the harbor, flags flying. We drifted out with them. Hundreds of boats - over 200 - made a magnificent parade through Victoria Harbor. The sailors on the Oriole were listening to rap and they had a pretty amazing sound system. "You didn't know we were the party boat, did you?" One of their sailors yelled. We had our music on also, and the Bravo Zulu battle flags were flapping in the wind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">9:20am was our race start. Low winds had been predicted but our sails were full. Denny had invested in a new number 2 genoa and it was crisp. I put my face to it to smell the new sail smell before we raised it. The cannon on the committee boat blasted a blank into the air to signal the race start. The shores were crowded people watching and they waved as we started off.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our crew had been divided into two watches - Bravo watch and Zulu watch. At noon, Bravo watch was off and I went below to make lunch and take a nap. Four hours later when Bravo watch started again we were still ahead of our fleet but the tides were changing. The wind had changed as well, and it was no longer pushing us - it was merely serving as a wind anchor. Our boat speed was less than a knot. By the time it got dark, several of the boats ahead of us had already given up on the race and they passed us, motoring back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Watching the peaks of land on the American shore slide behind us was slower than watching paint dry. The only comfort was that everyone was stuck in the same light air. As it grew dark, the lights on the Canadian vessel that served as the mark grew slowly brighter, and the lights on the triangular shadows that were nearby sailboats did also.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The mark was finally upon us. As we drifted slowly nearer to the mark we realized that the current was carrying us sideways faster than the wind was carrying us forward. I was hiking with all my might and I prepared to fend off the vessel by kicking it with my feet if necessary. I could see the boat operators coming outside to see if we would crash. Even in the dark I was close enough to see the whites of their eyes. Thankfully, Denny expertly tacked the boat when we were about 9 feet away. It lost us some efficiency but it also saved us from a crash.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We got a chuckle as another boat prepared to round the mark and reported over the radio: "We are about 400 feet away from the mark. We should be there sometime within the next 4 hours."</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After rounding the mark at Cape Flattery we headed North back to the Canadian coast to try our luck there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sunday May 26th - Day Two of the Race</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bravo watch took over again at 4am. Apparently Taylor had had some sort of run in with the boom during the wee hours of the morning and suffered a concussion. As a doctor, Brenda was upset that we weren't motoring back, but Taylor seemed to be doing ok. Erica wanted to motor back also, as she had plans to leave on the Victoria Clipper that afternoon and was eager to join the majority of sailors who had already quit the race. We weren't doing that though. In fact, there was a rumor running around that we didn't have enough fuel to motor back if we tried.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The day also promised to be as beautiful, if as windless, as the previous day. Bravo watch was still in good cheer and uninjured, although we had used up all of our dirty jokes and didn't have much left to talk about. There was one boat ahead of us that was worrying everyone. "Could that be Red Heather?" Red Heather was a boat from Victoria in our class and they were leagues ahead of us. We weren't close enough to make out their sail numbers yet, but the coloration and size indicated that it was them. We had crossed to the Canadian side and were getting better winds. We seemed to be gaining on them. I was finally able to make out their numbers with the binoculars. "9...6...0...9...6...Yup, that's them alright!" To win we had to beat them by at least ten minutes, and we were currently about ten minutes behind. We tried several strategies to get ahead, but each time they managed to pull ahead. Clearly they knew the tides and winds here better than we did.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although we were still moving as slow as mud, Denny suggested we suffix everything with "And we're winning." As in "The current is going to start carrying us backwards in one hour. And we're winning!" Or, "We have one knot of boat speed. And we're winning!" Despite the optimism, the strain of racing (and little sleep) was clearly wearing everyone a bit thin. I was happy to be relieved by Zulu watch, and the only thing that I was doing was helping to move the jib around on the roll tacks. I can't imagine what it would be like to drive the boat for the entire race, or to be in charge of something as delicate as trimming a sail for days on end. Also, I'm thankful that I sleep so well on boats.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By the time I woke up four hours later we'd passed Race Rocks and were out of the worst of the tide. Also, Red Heather had somehow fallen off and was now receding into a line of distant boats. Perhaps our joking optimism had carried us through and we <em>were</em> winning! We hadn't planned to be out for dinner so I scavenged some cans of tuna and olives and made make-shift wraps for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We were in sight of Victoria Harbor when the currents switched. We noticed first by the line of water off the back of some crab pots. Then it started to carry us backward. The wind seeker wasn't working anymore, so we raised a spinnaker and Taylor held out the edge of the sail with a boat hook. Our boat speed was zero. We cheered as the wind started to fill the sail and the knot meter rose to 0.1 knots. As we waited for the boat to move, darkness fell. Every boat that we could see was far behind us, and we knew that none of the boats had finished the Cape Flattery course yet. We might be both first in our division and first overall. Hell, we might even be the <em>only </em>boat to finish the Cape Flattery Course! The time passed quickly for me as I concentrated on the wind and my excitement. Several more boats who had quit motored past us. Buoyed by Christa's remarks that we might be the only boat left in our class, we hung in and sailed the boat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The instruments on the mast began to blink. We were losing battery power. Steve tried to start the engine in neutral to recharge the battery but there wasn't even enough battery for that. We quickly scrounged some bow and stern lights so that we wouldn't be disqualified after our 30+ hours of racing. We also remembered to put on our safety gear as another precaution against disqualification.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Two hours passed like this. Then four. We were in sight of the finish line - a red strobe on one side of the harbor entrance and a blinking yellow light on the other. Then a whistle blew. Or was it a horn? It didn't matter. We were finally back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They gave us hot chicken soup and champagne at the inspection dock and took our photographs. I didn't realize that I was hungry until I ate the soup. There were handshakes and congratulations. Everyone was smiling, especially Denny.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I headed back to the hotel with Kerry, Wayne and Shayne. On the way back I ran through the sprinklers on the lawn of a fancy looking building covered in Christmas lights. A guard on the lawn noticed me so I sprinted back. "What was that building?" I asked Shayne. "That's the capitol building. Victoria is the capitol of B.C." "Ahhhh." I looked behind me nervously, but thankfully the guard wasn't following. Back at the hotel, we were almost too tired to fall asleep, and ended up giggling for an hour like high school girls at a slumber party. "My boyfriend just texted me that he thinks The Flying Italian got first," Kerry reported. "But he doesn't know much about ratings in sailing, so I doubt that's right."</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Monday May 27th - Delivery Home</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just in case I got bored on the delivery home, I'd brought a book to read. It wasn't needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The wind blew like no other wind I have ever seen. It was like it was making up for the past two days of windlessness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We ran out of fuel motoring against the current on the way to drop Kerry off in Port Townsend, so we put a reef in the mainsail and raised it as the rain pelted us and waves sloshed over the bow. The wind was blowing 45 knots and we were making 9 knots of boat speed with just a reefed main. Denny was sick in his berth, and Leif was throwing up over the rail. I managed to get soaked as the water coming over the sides of the boat came up my foulies. I changed my wet socks and shirt twice. Even though I wanted to stay out and watch the weather I was finally shivering so uncontrollably that I had to go below and wrap up in a blanket. Steve and a friend, Tim, who was helping out with the delivery, were driving and they did an amazing job, depositing us safely at Customs in Port Townsend. Denny lent me some of his dry clothes and we had a late lunch at a tiny fish and chips joint, before refueling and heading back to Seattle. Here we learned that we had taken second overall in the race, and first in our division. The Flying Italian was the overall winner, having corrected over us by less than a minute. It was disappointing to learn that we weren't overall winner, but it was still exciting to have finished at all. We were all too exhausted or seasick from the delivery down to smile, but it had been a race well sailed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Startup Weekend Maker Edition: Organizer's Perspective</title>
      <link>/writing/254</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend is my first Startup Weekend as an organizer. I've attended 3 previously as a participant, and I've had my mind blown by the intensity of the weekend and the projects and teams that were created. Behind the scenes is a whole different level of intensity.
When I contacted Tawnee, operations manager at Startup Weekend HQ, in January, begging her to do a Startup Weekend for Makers, I didn't really expect her to get back to me. A few days later she sent me some names of other people who might also be interested in organizing a Startup Weekend focused on hardware.  Apparently, people who wanted a Startup Weekend for makers had reached a critical mass, and when <a title="Makerhaus" href="http://www.makerhaus.com/" target="_blank">Makerhaus</a> agreed to host the event it was a done deal. The task of putting together an organizing team was put into my (inexperienced) hands. I reached out to some friends and was lucky to have a team of twelve rockstars join me. Since March we've been hustling for sponsorships, making lists of necessary materials, and reaching out to maker groups to find talented participants.</p>
<p>It wasn't until June that it sunk in that Startup Weekend Maker Edition was going to be fundamentally different from any previous Startup Weekend. For one thing, it takes a lot more planning. We have to provide all the materials to make 10 successful hardware startups in one weekend. Also, it takes a lot more sponsorships, since materials cost money. Thankfully, sponsors like <a href="http://www.madrona.com/" target="_blank">Madrona</a>, <a href="http://www.impinj.com/" target="_blank">Impinj</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.1oaktechnologies.com/" target="_blank">10AK</a>, <a href="http://www.blackedge.com/" target="_blank">Blackedge</a>, <a href="http://www.pchintl.com/" target="_blank">PHC International</a>, Coca Cola, and several more stepped in to cover our costs.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line in the planning, we did something right. That became clear tonight as soon as the participants started to arrive. They had the eager look of passionate people - people who really wanted to be there and were going to make this an amazing event. Unlike other tech events in Seattle, where people tend to avoid eye contact and stare at their feet, the people at this event talking, laughing and sketching their ideas on napkins. They seemed excited to have found an entire room full of people who shared their passion for making things.</p>
<p>Another difference between this event and a normal Startup Weekend was the energy of the coaches and judges. Usually Startup Weekend coaches are too busy doing their own thing to be there for the whole event. But most of our coaches showed up on Friday night and were there to give the teams tips right from the start. We had coaches even offering to help carry food and set up tables and chairs.</p>
<p>Some things were, of course, the same. There was a rousing speech by our facilitator John Morefield at 7pm. There were pitches from 7:30-8pm - and what an amazing bunch of pitches they were! An autonomous greenhouse...a simple piece of hardware to tell you if you have a sleep disorder...a gadget that will project your cell phone screen onto the ceiling...</p>
<p>We took votes, and the 30+ great pitches were narrowed down to 10 excellent pitches. Teams formed. Sticky notes and note pads were passed out, and everyone went into planning mode.</p>
<p>My task for tomorrow morning is to get the teams the materials they need. Each team filled out a materials spreadsheet, and we've compiled these to a master spreadsheet that contains everything from sheets of acrylic to urethane and silicon for casting, to hot glue guns and grommets. Getting these materials reminds me of a science fair project for adults. I'm excited to wake up early tomorrow and go on a scavenger hunt for parts. And I'm even more excited to see what the teams make with these parts. Let the fun begin!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>White River 50 Mile</title>
      <link>/writing/262</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Admittedly, it was a terrible idea. I signed up for the race in May because my running partner, Brad, pressured me into signing up. "If you can run 20 miles on back to back days, you can totally do 50."
For some reason, I thought he meant 50K, even though 50 miles is in the name of the race. But, details. Another detail I missed was the part about climbing 8,900ft. There is almost 18,000ft total elevation change over the course of the race, which climbs parts of Crystal Mountain and has views of Mount Rainier. If I had known about that, I might have practiced. My coworker Dawn asked if I was going to run on Friday. "No, I'm tapering," I told her.</p>
<p>"Ah, how long have you been tapering?"</p>
<p>"About 6 months."</p>
<p>Speaking of unprepared, I hadn't realized that we wouldn't have phone service in the shadow of Crystal Mountain. Brad and I planned on Friday to meet at a campground, since I was leaving Seattle later than him. But by the time I got there, at 10:30pm, it was too dark to find him, especially since I had no idea what his car looked like. Also, the campsite was full. The only place to sleep was on the concrete floor of the picnic pavilion. Also, my sleeping bag is currently on its way to Sandusky, Ohio, where I will be camping next weekend for Thistle Nationals. So all I had to sleep on were 2 ponchos. I slept fitfully, and woke at 5am. We had to be at the start line by 6 and my stomach felt like it was in knots.</p>
<p>Thankfully, at the start line I had one bar of service, and was able to get a call from Brad's brother, who also had service. I was so relieved to see Brad. I knew that I couldn't do this race without him. For one thing, he is a constant source of entertainment.</p>
<p>"Let's start at the front of the pack," he said. "That way, only 398 runners will have to pass us."</p>
<p>We didn't though - instead we started at the back of the pack, well behind the elites, as we intended to finish in the bottom 10%, if at all. Brad confided that he hadn't practiced either. Neither of us had run more than 14 miles in the past six months.</p>
<p>The first part of the race is a 15 mile climb that goes up 4,000 feet or so. I didn't even feel them. I was too busy laughing at Brad's hilariously inappropriate stories. I could tell other runners were trying to run closer to us just to hear his stories. At the top of the mountain there were spectacular views. I felt like I was in The Sound of Music with the alpine peaks all around me. The third aid station was right there. Brad and I had a dropbag that we had sent up. He had put an extra pair of shoes and some pitas in his bag. I had added a Four Loko and some extra socks. The Four Loko was more of a joke than anything else - I had mentioned on the way down that I had never tried one, so Tony suggested that I get one at the next gas station, and I did.</p>
<p>Brad and I spread out for a full on picnic at the aid station. We attempted to drink the Four Loko but it was too disgusting to get down. We probably sat there picnicking for 15 minutes. Brad announced that he was dropping out. His calves were cramping up and he couldn't run any further. "You'll do great," he encouraged me. "Just make sure you make it before the last aid stations close down, or you're screwed."</p>
<p>I took off, feeling amazing. I put my headphones in since Brad was no longer there to entertain me. I had a playlist that consisted of only four songs, since I'd forgotten to download music for the run.</p>
<p>I passed everyone who had passed us at the aid station. The pack had thinned out and I was no longer following anyone. Good thing the course was well marked. I got to a part where the trail split, and there was a big arrow pointing the way on the ground. Great. I was running at a good pace now. There was a photographer on the trail. I gave him a thumbs up. About a mile later I saw an aid station. And then I realized - this was the aid station I had just been at. I was running backwards. The volunteers realized it too, as they took down my number. "Uh...you were already here weren't you?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry, you only have to run about 2 miles back that way and you'll find the course."</p>
<p>"Thanks," I said, and took off again. I was crestfallen. This pretty much ruined any chance I had of doing well. Thankfully, the next 15 miles were downhill. I am a great downhill runner. Years of skiing and cycling have strengthened my quads and made me fearless on the downhill. I'm basically a mountain goat. I only face-planted once.</p>
<p>At the next aid station I took my shirt off and threw it away. A volunteer told me that it smelled like a locker room. He dumped a bottle of water over my arms, legs and face to clean the dust off. I pinned my number to my sports bra.</p>
<p>At the next aid station the volunteers all tilted their heads when I arrived. It turns out that I had pinned my number on upside down. Tony was waiting for me at the aid station at the bottom of the mountain. "You are a mess," he told me. "But you're right on track to finishing in 10 or 11 hours."</p>
<p>"I feel great," I said. But actually my stomach was feeling weird. I couldn't eat anything, so I kept running. After what Brad had said, I was afraid of the aid stations closing down before I arrived, and this was starting to feel a bit less like a casual stroll. Unfortunately, the next 10 miles were uphill again, and it was hot by now. The miles between 27 and 37 were by far the hardest. My butt was hurting from so much hill running. Also, my arms were starting to chafe. That is how you know your arms are too fat - when they chafe as you run. Other than the pain, I felt amazing. I usually use my running time to think, but I had outrun the thinking part. I was unable to think about anything useful. In fact, I don't think I was thinking at all.</p>
<p>After the 37 mile point there were six miles of downhill running. I bombed down them, passing lots of people. I wasn't feeling great, but I wasn't feeling awful. I thought about throwing up, but I couldn't. I thought about dropping out, but dropping out isn't allowed after the seventh aid station. Besides, I was so close. Finally, the bottom of the hill was right there. At the last aid station, I took my shoes off and realized that my new socks were completely coated in dust and sweat. I was amazed to not have any blisters however.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I was wearing new shoes? I should have broken them in first. Oh well, they are broken in now. Also, I doubt I will be getting my 30 day money back guarantee after this race.</p>
<p>There were only about seven miles of slightly uphill technical terrain to go. I looked at my phone. It was 5pm. I decided to run 20 minutes and walk 5 for the last bit. I looked at my phone after I thought I had been running for about 20 minutes. It was 5:05. The problem was that my quads were all stiff from sprinting down the hill. I tried skipping to shake them out. Wrong decision. My knee suddenly experienced a shooting pain. I tried jogging on it and realized that there was no way I could run. I had to keep my knee straight just to be able to walk on it. Only five miles to go to the finish, and I was injured. I felt incredibly frustrated. If I hadn't gotten lost I would certainly be finishing by now.</p>
<p>I walked with a weird limp through the rest of the beautiful forest. Lots of old people passed me. But old people had been passing me all day so that was really nothing new. That's the problem with these really tough endurance races - old people are always passing you. I didn't really mind though - my brain was on a different planet. I was euphoric. I really wanted to just stop and lie down. I wanted to cry too. I was happy, but I really wanted to cry. Also, why was there a person watching me from the top of that tree? Oh, it wasn't a person, just a branch. Then I saw another person wearing a black robe. I thought maybe it was a witch. Or a bear. But it was just a root. Almost there. I started singing so that I wouldn't feel my knee anymore.</p>
<p>I managed to make it to the road where the finish was. Somehow I was able to run the last half mile.</p>
<p>And there I was, jogging through the finish after 13 hours of "running." I had been dreaming of putting my legs in the river for about 4 hours. After the finish, Tony helped me down the hill I sat down in the river, still wearing my shorts. It was everything I had dreamed it would be. My sore feet felt all tingly. I wanted to just stay there and sleep, but Tony made me get out. Then he gave me a piggy back ride to the tent where they were giving out t-shirts and socks.</p>
<p>I put on my t-shirt and socks right away. It felt good to be wearing something that didn't smell like a locker room.</p>
<p>And that was it. That was what running a 50 miler feels like. Next time I run a 50 mile race I will practice first. Also, I won't wear new shoes. And I will make a playlist that includes more than four songs.</p>
<p>But whatever - at least it was good exercise.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Thistle Sailing Nationals</title>
      <link>/writing/266</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I flew to Ohio. Thistle Nationals were being held on Lake Erie, at the port town of Sandusky.
No, Thistle Nationals is not a Scottish Dancing Competition or the highland games. A thistle is a seventeen foot sailboat, sailed by three people. You can read more about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thistle_(dinghy)">here</a>. They are light, fast, and tippy. On our three person team at nationals I was in charge of the bow, which means that I have to move around a lot and I frequently knock myself on various parts of the boat that stick out. My crewmate Dave was in charge of the middle of the boat. My skipper Wayne is the one who made the boat go.</p>
<p>Being from the East Coast, it seemed odd for Ohio to be my "vacation" destination, but I was drawn by the allure of competing in anything called "nationals." I've always wanted to compete at the national level at a sport, any sport.</p>
<p>Making a Thistle move through the water at seven knots (about the speed of a fast jog) is an art form that involves quite a bit of cursing. As everyone knows, the louder you curse, the faster the boat moves.</p>
<p>"Take down the F$@@#!ing spinnaker pole!"</p>
<p>"I'm taking down the m#%$!!F*^#@ing spinnaker pole!"</p>
<p>And the boat glides on, so fast that it creates an unseen wake.</p>
<p>Wayne's license plate on his van is in a frame that says "Thistle Sailing. Faster than fast." Oh, also his license plate reads "Thistle." Did I mention he is a little obsessed? This year he also happened to be Vice President of the Thistle Fleet. Unfortunately, that meant that he was in charge of 53 trophies. It seemed strange that there were 110 boats at nationals and 53 trophies. There are trophies for various categories: "highest finish for a skipper from west of the Mississippi", "highest finish for a skipper over 60", "highest finish for a woman skipper." I assume that by creating so many trophies, the Thistle class meant to be inclusive and make sure that everyone who raced hard got a trophy. What it meant for Wayne is that he had to keep track of the placement of each skipper in each category. What it meant for me, as Wayne's crew, was that I had to polish an awful lot of silver.</p>
<p>Thankfully I had help. Rather than polishing the trophies in the back room, we took them out into the clubhouse after dinner and polished them in front of everybody. We were awarded with free beers and appreciation.</p>
<p>Speaking of beers, at the same time that Thistle Nationals was going on, the self-proclaimed Flip Cup Nationals was also going on. I did not partake, but at night we could hear the cheers of the participants from our tents. "Why are they all yelling 'USA'?" My tent neighbor, Tracy Jean, wondered. "Aren't we all from the USA?" This question was never answered.</p>
<p>On the racecourse though, many of my questions about sailing were answered. For instance, I learned how to pee off the side of a dinghy when you're out sailing for 8 hours at a time. I also learned to read the sailing instructions very carefully, and that the finish line is almost always restricted.</p>
<p>Although we did not get a trophy, I did have the pleasure of getting dressed up and handing out the trophies to the deserving winners. I thought that I knew which trophies were which, but when I arrived at the banquet at the yacht club and saw 53 gleaming perpetual trophies, as well as over 100 smaller trophies for the winners to keep, I freaked. I may have handed out a few wrong trophies, but everyone seemed fairly content with their extra shiny silver cups.</p>
<p>We didn't do so poorly either though. We were 44th out of 110 boats. Sailing Thistles is hard, and the competition is tremendous. I couldn't believe the skill of some of the other crews. There is so much to think about, between wind angle, keeping clear of other boats, getting room around a mark, preventing the boat from heeling too much, and a million other things. The smallest mistake can cost you 10 boat lengths, and you can never sail a perfect race.</p>

      <title>Growing Up with Ken Ham - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</title>
      <link>/writing/278</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246afc/1428727515647/how-do-you-explain-a-sunset-if-there-is-not-god-2.jpg"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246afc/1428727515647/how-do-you-explain-a-sunset-if-there-is-not-god-2.jpg" alt="how-do-you-explain-a-sunset-if-there-is-not-god-2" class="wp-image-279 aligncenter" /></a>On the spectrum of Christians who believe that God put dinosaur fossils in the Earth to test our faith, and Theistic Evolutionists, my parents are somewhere in the middle. They were also my science teachers for the first 12 years of my life.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ken Ham's books were part of our homeschool curriculum.  In Answers in Genesis he goes to extreme lengths to show that the laws of science and the literal Bible can coexist, and even that one proves the other. My Dad taught me that there had been room for all of the creatures on the arc because Noah took one of each genus, not one of each species. The "evolution" that Darwin had observed in finches was in fact simply the display of the diverse genome that God had created them with.  As a 10 year old, all of this made sense, especially when combined with a semester of learning apologetics in Sunday School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 7th grade I went to a Christian school where the science education was even more laughably abysmal. Basically, any questions that were raised were silenced with "God created it like that." When they didn't answer my questions, I lost respect for my teachers and I got in trouble frequently (mostly for doodling during class, which I'm certain has served me better in the long run than actually paying attention to our "history lessons" about the Tower of Babel). Thankfully my parents didn't send me back, and I went to public high school a few years later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a good side to learning this, and that was that I learned to question everything. Kids who are taught the prevailing wisdom of science never have their beliefs challenged. In fact, in High School I was surprised to find many atheists who were as dogmatic and wonderless as their fundamentalist religious counterparts. I'm glad that I was reminded over and over again that evolution was "only" a theory, because this has put all of human scientific discovery into perspective for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Religion gave us the frameworks for the science that we have today. In fact, much of the science that we do now is done in the name of humanism - a direct descendant of Western religion.  Scientists who think they can achieve objectivity are like people who have never travelled and don't realize they have an accent.  For all of the trash talking that faith gets, you can’t have science without faith in constants. It can be absurd when fundamentalist Science battles fundamentalist religion, because the two end up sounding similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don't want to say that Ken Ham <em>isn't</em> an idiot (albeit a wealthy one) or that it's fine to teach Creationism as fact and the Bible as science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6ade4b0a8996a246aff/1428727516571/Screen-Shot-2014-02-10-at-4.38.39-PM.png.39-PM.png?format=original"><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6ade4b0a8996a246aff/1428727516571/Screen-Shot-2014-02-10-at-4.38.39-PM.png.39-PM.png?format=original" alt="Scripture abandoned in the home leads to a generation no different from the world." class="size-medium wp-image-285" /></a></p>
<p>For me, one of the worst effects of growing up with creationism was the loss of wonder.  I lost interest in the life sciences because there was nothing new to be discovered. Jesus had to come back in the next few thousand years, before the Earth could go through any drastic changes that would prevent human life and cause us to seek refuge on the nearest habitable planet. My textbooks mocked scientists who searched for other forms of life in the cosmos. How dare they waste their money searching for something that God had decreed couldn't exist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Ugly:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By far the worst thing about growing up with Creationism is the fear. I became afraid of insulting a vindictive God by imagining that there were life beyond His perfect Earth, or that life had originated in any other way than the 7 day process described in a 4,000 year old book. To deny creation would be to deny God's perfection. How could evolution have happened if God had created a world without death? The main reason for clinging to Creationism is to prove that we humans <em>caused</em> death. Our collective sin, of which we are all guilty, caused all of the pain and suffering in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things have evolved slightly since the day of Copernicus and Galileo. Baptists and Presbyterians won't pull out your fingernails or use a thumb screw on you if you believe that the Earth wasn't created in seven days.  Many do, however, have the power to excommunicate or "discipline" members if they don't believe that: "The Bible is the revelation of God's truth and is infallible and authoritative in all matters of life and practice.*"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Good (again)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to end this post on a negative note, so I'll revisit the positive. The good is the fact that I don't believe Creationism anymore. When I stopped believing it was less like the disillusionment of realizing that Santa isn't real and more like being let out of a dark closet for the first time. Clearly, some worldviews are better for my sanity than others, and I'm glad that the one that is backed by science isn't the one where a bunch of old men decide who is and who isn't allowed to speak in church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving up creationism means that my sense of wonder has been restored with a vengeance. All of the things that I wasn't supposed to wonder as a 10 year old I now wonder about in full force. Is there life in the stars? Is the universe infinite? Are there infinite versions of myself? If I can imagine God, does that make God possible? And if she is possible, in an infinite universe must she exist?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know the answers. I don't expect to ever know the answers. But I can search and imagine and wonder, and this is beautiful.</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Hola Monica! Guess who. As one of the parents, now I get to weigh in with my comments here. As I have always said, don’t dish it out unless you can take it. I hope you retain your sense of wonder, or at least a sense of humor as you read this. I was really puzzled by the title since I thought at first the whole post was from Ken Ham's daughter! No joke. Silly Me. Then when I realized it was written by you, I was more confused since I didn't recall that Ken Ham ever lived in our house. But really, you could have more accurately called the post "Growing up with Brian Jacques" or "Growing up with Dorothy Sayers" or "Growing up with Rafi" or "Growing up with Atawalpa Yupanqui" or "Growing up with Roussas Rushdoony" or "Growing up with Bob Dylan" or "Growing up with Augustine" or “Growing up with Richard Scarry” or "Growing up with Tolstoy" or...and on. The amount of ink on paper or words on cd's of any one of those would be waaayyyy more than what you would find of Ken Ham's. His ideas and writings were a very minimal part of our curriculum, and not only that, but they were balanced by views of others that we put forth with very different theses. Not only THAT, we even let you go to a high school and university where  evolutionary biology was taught, either as theory or as fact. Just sayin... so you know we weren't afraid of the Bogeyman. So seems to me, Ken Ham had a teensy, weensy itsy, bitsy (polka dot) spot on the shelf of our home, and your life.
Any way... to the blog. As for being your science teachers for the first 12 years of your life-not...exactly... Our good friend, E. Mc., was that from about ages 9-12. Talk about wonder and creativity. You would be hard-pressed to name any teacher, science or other, that you had in school who could elicit more wonder about the world and a drive to study it. Go ahead, I dare ya.
When you mention "growing up with creationism", if by that you mean believing in a literal 6 day creation and young earth, well au contraire, cuz that is not what we taught as fact or subscribed to or ever made you subscribe to. Period. 
(Maybe I am all mixed up- is this blog really just a piece for your next collection of short fiction? If that’s the case, then, never mind.)
But if not, it is really quite a stretch to pin the blame on your parents for losing your sense of wonder. Big accusation you know. But it won’t hold up in court. I have eyewitness testimony. I don't believe you ever lost your sense of wonder- rather more likely it got lost in a world of adolescent and young adult identity crises that suppressed your childhood inquisitiveness for a time, making you too preoccupied with self to see anything outside of that. (Gee, what an original story line that is.) 
I will for the record here, rebut and assert that in our family we did (and still do) discuss all manner of natural sciences, wildlife, biology, chemistry, ornithology, philosophy, theology, linguistics, history economics, art,  literature, pop culture, music, dance (and sports even) woodworking, and the value of chia seeds in our home, usually at dinnertime,(dinnertime??) which is more than probably 90% of families in America do. That makes room for a whole lotta wonderin’.  And we introduced you to many gifted and brilliant people who also emulated this like-minded thirst for knowledge and wonder. Do you remember the books? Like ALL over the house on shelves everywhere and in boxes?   Who encouraged you to study languages and cultures and take the opportunity to travel- to Chile, to Mexico, to Argentina, to France? You owe a good deal of what you know about the natural sciences to your parents' own knowledge and interests. As your Dad is always fond of quoting Aristotle - "Philosophy begins in wonder." 
YOU, dear daughter, with all of your amazing talents and inquisitiveness, are living on the capital of the faith that you grew up amidst; the faith that spawns a sense of the creative and curious. You even thanked me for homeschooling you a few months ago, did you not?
Regarding the fear you had of insulting a vindictive god being a result of your growing up with creationism-that sure caused some head-scratching since our faith does not include a vindictive God, so I don’t have a clue what that is all about. You have read the Bible and know what kind of God it reveals. It is not your sense of wonder that has been restored with a vengeance so much as your sense of vengeance that has been restored with a vengeance that I am reading here.
  I do need to call you out on your fact-finding (i.e. the footnote part)now so let's set the record straight. You say this: "Many do, however, have the power to "excommunicate" or “discipline” members if they don’t believe that: 'The Bible is the revelation of God’s truth and is infallible and authoritative in all matters of life and practice.*'" Then your footnote leads us to the webpage of a particular PCA church. the fact is that the PCA church cannot and does not excommunicate or discipline any member for not believing in 6 day creation, or even creation at all. To use a link to a doctrinal statement from a denomination that very clearly and intentionally does NOT require its members to believe what you claim they do is nothing short of false advertising.(hint: that's a euphemism.) 
Well there you have it. A mother’s 2 cents. FWIW. Keep on wondering. I hope you always stay in that magical "Why" stage.
I Love you,
and I'm still,
Your Mom</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 0</title>
      <link>/writing/298</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My stomach had twinges of nervousness on Sunday morning. It was a perfect day and I couldn't wait to start cycling.  Everything was packed and I was ready to hit the road for San Francisco. But first, Sunday brunch had to be eaten. Despite the butterflies I managed to cram down a "Seattle to Portland" omelette at Dish cafe. Tony noticed that our bill was $36.66. "The sign of the beast," he joked. "And today's the 13th." I added. "We're going to have bad luck."
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before heading out I had to bike back to my boat to pick up some things I'd forgotten like sunscreen, a headlamp, and bugspray. It was noon already by the time I was ready to leave. But wait, I hadn't actually changed the clock on my boat for daylight savings time. It wasn't noon - it was 1pm already. That's when I suggested that both of us drive to Centralia and camp there. That way I could wake up and bike to Portland the next day and Tony could drive back and go to work. Tony was down. I felt relieved. For some reason, I didn't feel ready to bike to Portland by myself. We biked to his apartment to get his car. He was just ahead of me, and I saw him, standing with his bike, in the shadow of the garage. His face was blank. I biked up next to him and looked at what he was looking at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His car was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just gone. We stared at the space for a while, as if staring at the space would bring his car back. Then Tony ran upstairs to call the police. We waited for three hours for them. Meanwhile, we tried every ride sharing service we could think of. I realized that I have never received my Zipcar card in the mail, and Tony's membership had lapsed and had to be renewed. That was out. We tried relay ride, a really cool carsharing service, but no success there either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police man showed up and told us that the car would certainly be recovered. He said it was a question of when, not if.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was 5pm. We gave up on our camping plans, and I decided to start my trip on Monday instead of unlucky Sunday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186909">
I had to postpone my bike trip by one day because of a stolen car (read the previous post).</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186914">By Monday morning, my jitters had doubled. I was so ready to start cycling that I was shaking. The weather was still perfect. A hearty breakfast was still necessary. Also, the long&nbsp;anticipated Windows phone update was finally available, and I had to plug in my phone and wait for it to update.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186919">Of course, I didn't have to do any of this. I was just doddling. Even though I plan to come back to Seattle, there was something difficult about leaving. I have always loved the story of El Cid. As&nbsp;I prepared to travel to San Francisco on my bicycle, I felt that I knew what he felt when he was exiled. Of course, I was choosing to leave, not being thrown out of the city by force. And I was riding a red bicycle, not Babieca, the beautiful warhorse. Also, I didn't have any loyal followers and I wasn't a Spanish dude from the 9th century. So, really, there are no parallels to be drawn between me and El Cid, and I'm not even sure why I brought this up.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186924">My phone finished updating. I left and didn't look back.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186929">The only other bike trip greater than a week that I've done was in the south of France. The south of Washington isn't the south of France. In fact, the south of Washington is kind of a depressing place, with creepy,&nbsp;Lynchian&nbsp;&nbsp;undertones. Even on a beautiful day, the rotting cabins in the&nbsp;fir forests and the roadsides littered with bottles and shattered glass are eerie and sinister.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186934">For as much as I praise the West Coast, I&nbsp;now believe that the Puget Sound is Washington's only redeeming part. There were a few nice rails to trails paths, but otherwise I was on narrow roads where apparently most people had never heard of the "give cyclists 3 feet of space" rule. With few exceptions,&nbsp;pickup truck drivers&nbsp;seem to be especially bad at giving space.&nbsp;They also have apparently never heard of fences for pitbulls in the south of Washington and I had a couple of terrifying encounters with dogs larger than myself. The only other people I saw riding bicycles were toothless methheads riding BMX bikes.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186939">I know I sound a bit negative and maybe a touch judgemental. It's because one thing happened that made me have a really bad day. I had a running&nbsp;armband that I had put my ID and some cash in, as well as my phone. I tied it to my handlebars to help me navigate. I was using GPXViewer to navigate, but I realized that I had the wrong path - I'd downloaded a gpx file that had me going down I5. To figure out the correct route, I used Google maps, which quickly used up my phone battery. I placed it in my pouch to charge on my portable charger and kept riding. Many miles and hills later, I looked down at my handlebars, and realized that the armband was gone.&nbsp; My ID and cash were gone too. The only thing to do was to backtrack and find the ID.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186944">Two hours later I still hadn't found it. I'd been over every inch of road for 25 miles, slowly searching for the armband, but it just wasn't to be found. I decided keep going. So back it was, over the roads that I had already covered twice. By 7pm it was obvious I wasn't going to make it to Centralia. The wind was blowing strong and night was falling.&nbsp; In the town of Yelm, 30 miles north of where I'd hoped to be by then, I found a random Walmart. I washed my face in their bathroom, bought and consumed half a jar of nutella, and set my tent up in a field across the road. The wind was blowing so hard that the tent was shaking and it was hard to fall asleep. My eyes were filled with dust and when I closed them they hurt.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_186949">Before I went to bed though, Tony called to tell me that&nbsp;the car&nbsp;had been recovered&nbsp;in Pike Place. "And it still has half a tank of gas." He said. "I'm going to sell it tomorrow. I have no reason to own a car." And he sold it the next day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 3</title>
      <link>/writing/307</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154383">Wednesday morning I woke up&nbsp;a bit hungover. I'd celebrated a birthday with my couchsurfing host the night before. During the celebrations I knocked my phone off of a barstool and it fell about 3 feet. The screen blinked and turned an odd tinge of blue. I didn't think much of it, but Wednesday morning it was clear that it wasn't going to turn back on.&nbsp;I'd broken my phone. I went to the Verizon store, but they didn't have windows phones, so I left.
&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154386">I was now&nbsp;missing my phone and my ID and I still had about 900 miles to go. Also, my host had plans for the rest of the week, so he wasn't able to host me again. I decided to find a hostel. Unfortunately, the only hostels in town required ID. I still had my tablet, so I decided to find a coffee shop and figure out what to do from there.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154391">I chose the coffee shop that had the coolest bikes outside. There were two beautiful fixies. Clearly, this coffee shop, Coffee House Northwest, was a bastion of Portland culture. The barista asked where I was going. "To San Francisco,"&nbsp;I told him.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154396">"I want to do that," he said enthusiastically. "But I don't know if I would stop in San Francisco. I think I would keep going to Ecuador."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154401">Ray, the barista who wanted to go to&nbsp;Ecuador, made me the best&nbsp;almond milk latte I've ever had. I&nbsp;camped out at one of the tables and started sending emails to Tony, begging him to send me my old phone and my passport. Finally I caught him on Skype, and he agreed to&nbsp;send both next-day air. He also sent me&nbsp;a photo of my passport so that I would be able to stay at the hostel.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154407">Ray invited me to sit&nbsp;at the counter so that we could talk bikes as he worked. Clearly he was an expert barista - he not only got me to move away from the table that I was camping at - he also made me feel like he was actually interested in talking to me (he claims that his desire to talk bikes was sincere, and he wasn't just trying to get me to leave the table). It turns out that the black&nbsp;fixie with the pink rims outside was his. He invited me to come over to the garage where he keeps his bike tools once he was off work to see if he could fix the shifting on my bike.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154411">I spent the day in Portland, and around 5pm I headed over to the "bike shop." Not only was it a bike shop, it was also where Ray roasted coffee for work. There is something so innocent about Portland that I feel almost protective of it. It's the type of town that you read about in&nbsp;childrens' books - there is a community of happy people who work together and get along despite their differences. Baristas visit each other at their respective coffee shops. People hang out and listen to music and&nbsp;roast coffee and fix bikes and drink craft beers.&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154414">We did all of those things. I wasn't involved in the coffee roasting part, obviously, but I did learn a lot about coffee. I heard the beans' first crack as they roasted. It sounded a bit like popcorn popping. Ray got my gears shifting perfectly also. He showed me features that I never knew my bike had. Another friend showed up and Ray guided him in&nbsp;installing new handlebars on his own bike. I cleaned my bike and removed some of the grease that&nbsp;had&nbsp;built up on the derailleurs.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_154419">I strongly considered moving to Portland.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 4</title>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136897">
Wednesday&nbsp;night I had dreamed that I was stealing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches from children’s lunchboxes and eating them. I was happy to find peanut butter and jelly and artisan bread in the hostel kitchen. I helped myself to it liberally, before heading to Ray’s coffee shop for a soy latte.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136902">Ray and I charted a course. He told me that the best way to get out of town would be to take Cornell Road to the 26, the 26 to State Route 6, and then State Route 6 to the Tillamook, and then to Lincoln City if I made it that far, which was unlikely given that it was almost noon and I hadn’t started. He told me that once had ridden to Tillamook and back in one day. It was one of the happiest days of his life, he said.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136907">Back at the hostel, a package was waiting for me containing my phone and passport. It was pouring rain, so I had to unpack and repack my bags to get to my rain gear. Leaving the warm, dry hostel and the other young people playing board games and chatting in the common area was difficult.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136910">Leaving civilization is always difficult. It is never a desire, it is a compulsion. This, I realize, is why I had drawn the comparison between myself and El Cid. Whether you are compelled by something internal or external, leaving is always against your instinct to stay. Humans find safety in numbers. We find comfort in company. To leave the herd, you must fight this instinct.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136915">I was thinking these thoughts as I pushed myself out of the Willamette Valley on a bicycle and headed south. I came to the 26. It was a busy highway with a narrow margin for bikers. The rain was pouring by now though, and visibility was poor. I decided to attempt another route. I didn’t want to take my phone out of my bag in the pouring rain, so I decided to just try riding West. I set off. Riding without thinking of where I was going or how fast I was going gave my mind time to meditate. I thought about the past few days, and my time in Portland. I thought about my time cycling in France. I had had one day of rain the entire trip, and I had forgotten about it. I was leaving Arles, I think, and the rain was cold and wet, as April rain tends to be. I didn’t have far to go. I was staying in a town called Jonquieres, I think. But riding in the rain again, I remembered the misery of that ride, and how alone I had felt. Interesting how I had completely forgotten that day. I wondered if I would forget this day also, or if I would turn the memory of my soaked socks and sneakers and the way my raincoat soaked through and stuck to my bare skin into a happy memory of an adventure.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136920">And it was a happy memory. When the rain let up, I felt myself flying on two wheels through Suburban Oregon. And more suburban Oregon. And more suburban Oregon. And it started to rain again, and the sun got lower in the sky. And I passed under I5. But I was too lost in thought to notice. Until I got to the 26 again. This time I pulled my phone out of my bag and turned it on. I almost cried. I was past Beaverton, headed back into Portland. Instead of crying, I laughed. I had been riding in a circle all afternoon. I had to make a decision – whether to head back to Portland or turn around and continue heading to Tillamook. It was an easy decision. It was getting darker and rainier, I was soaked and shivering, and I knew there was a warm hostel bed waiting for me in Portland. I crossed over the 26th and climbed for a ways before heading towards the arboretum and zipping down curving, narrow roads through beautiful homes going faster than the speed limit. I returned to the hostel and walked in, dripping and covered in mud and gravel. They were full, they said, but I could call the hostel downtown. They were full too. I tried calling my friend Zach, but he was trecking in Nepal. So I called Ray and asked for yet another favour. “Maybe you know someone who could host a cyclist for a night?”</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_136923">He said he would try to find me a place, and invited me over until then. It was nice to be somewhere warm. I sat in one of his chairs and soaked through the cushions. He laughed it off. He let me use his shower and it was the best shower I have ever taken. None of his friends had space. “Do you mind if I crash on your floor?” I asked. He didn’t. Well that was easy. We planned my route for the next day. I had to be in Florence, where my next couchsurfing host lived. I could either do 169 miles going west out of the valley and then south, or I could do 176 miles going south through Oregon City and then west. Going South first had fewer hills, and since I was carrying 40 odd pounds of gear and water it made more sense. I was nervous. Cycling 175 miles in a day is not a small deal for me.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98425">
A week in. It doesn't seem like I've been on the road for this long. Today was another slow start and a&nbsp; slow ride day. To say the coastline here in Southern Oregon is "rolling" might be an understatement. It goes like this - I huff and puff up a giant hill, standing up to get over the top. Then I glide to the bottom without pedaling once. Than another hill. Then&nbsp;I soar&nbsp;to the bottom, probably going over the speed limit. The coast here is also known for it's giant sand dunes. I took one break to climb a few - they looked so&nbsp;irresistibly soft.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98431">I ended up getting sand everywhere, and the sand in my hair didn't come out for days. &nbsp;It was still worth it.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98437">I made plans yesterday to Skype my grandmother when my extended family was at her house eating Easter dinner. But the phone service was so spotty that I missed all of it. When I called at 3pm my time, everyone had gone home and my grandmother was the only one left. I was lying in the sun on a picnic table in the tiny town of Bandon. We chatted for a bit on the phone and I drank a coffee. Suddenly, a wild looking boy on a white fixed-gear bicycle loaded down in gear wheeled up with a huge smile on his face.&nbsp; He had long hair in a ponytail and was wearing super short jean cutoffs.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98442">He smiled and asked how I was, as if we had been friends forever. I honestly wasn't feeling too great. The night before I hadn't slept because I'd been so cold in my sleeping bag.&nbsp;Despite the sun and the&nbsp;nice weather I&nbsp;still couldn't get warm today, and I found myself shivering uncontrollably on this bench.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98445">"I'm good," I said.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98450">He introduced himself as Mark. A few minutes later, Steve rolled up. Steve at least was wearing padded bike shorts. His gear was in actual paniers. They weren't friends&nbsp;originally, but they were going the same pace so they were riding&nbsp;together.&nbsp;Steve was from Alaska and he was on a month long ride to try to grow as a person. Mark was from&nbsp;Vancouver by way of Manitoba and he had started two weeks earlier and was riding indefinitely. They were both 27 years old, although Mark looked much younger. All of us were born in July.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98455">We lay in the sun for about two hours and talked.&nbsp;Another man showed up randomly and started talking to Mark. Apparently, they knew each other from the road. Mark explained that&nbsp;they had met several miles before.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other man was from Seattle, and his recumbent bike&nbsp;had&nbsp;blown a&nbsp;tire and he was getting it fixed&nbsp;and staying in a motel in Bandon.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98458">I asked if I could ride with&nbsp;Mark and&nbsp;Steve&nbsp;and they were happy to include me. Mark seemed to almost to have been expecting me. We coasted along. Having them in front of me to break the wind took all of the effort out of riding. We went another 20 miles or so, and then rode 5 miles out into the misty forest to a lighthouse and a campsite in the state park.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98463">It was beyond beautiful.&nbsp;Probably because it was Easter Weekend, the campsite was empty. I had a long shower. Mark had an even longer shower - he was gone for about 2 hours. Steve made a fire. We drank wine, ate and talked. I hadn't even realized how much I had wanted someone to talk to. I had barely said a word to anyone since leaving Florence yesterday afternoon.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98468">Now that the sun had set, I was shivering uncontrollably again. Mark and Steve offered me their food. I pulled my sleeping bag out of the tent and draped it over my shoulders by the fire. "Oh, that's why you've been cold," said Mark. "You don't have the therma-rest."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_98473">Apparently, my type of sleeping bag's thermal rating (20 degrees) is based on having the therma-rest to go with it. This was why I had frozen the night before. When I bought it, the clerk at REI hadn't even mentioned this. I&nbsp;felt a little bit pissed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85953">You'll notice I've lumped 3 days into one. Three muddy, miserable days.
</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85956">I had hoped to make up some miles in California, but a giant mountain covered in giant trees appeared out of nowhere and slowed my progress. Tuesday&nbsp;afternoon was when the rain started.&nbsp;The forest and the rain made the road too dark to see, and the road's shoulder ended so giant semis were passing me with inches to spare. &nbsp;A&nbsp;motel appeared through the trees. I decided to stop and get a room. I was clearly the only one there. There was no phone service and no internet. I asked the white-haired clerk at the front desk if I might be able to order some food and she just laughed at me.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85962">I've seen Psycho, so I know what happens at deserted motels in the middle of nowhere. I put a chair in front of the door, and I didn't linger in the shower. It was nice to have a room though. I was able to wash my clothes in the sink and spread my wet things over every surface to dry.&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85965">On Wednesday, the rain cleared up in the morning. I stopped at the first gas station I came to to eat. The cashier asked if I was cycling by myself. "Aren't you afraid?" She scolded. "You should be careful."</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85971">I wondered if she would have said it if I were a male cyclist. &nbsp;So many people along my ride said similar things, and it rubbed me the wrong way. &nbsp;I'm not a child who is going to accept candy from strangers. I'm also not a precious vessel that exists to provide a womb for the next generation. I don't need to be protected. I understand the risks and I knowingly accept them. Why do you take it upon yourself to warn me of dangers? Are you trying to get me to doubt myself? Would you prefer it if I had stayed home? Do you think women shouldn't have adventures, shouldn't risk our lives, shouldn't ride bikes, shouldn't travel, shouldn't meet new and interesting people?</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85976">If you want to give me advice about safety, I have some words for you. Get the #@$! out of my way.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85981">Wednesday didn't stay clear for long. Once again, I didn't make my goal distance because I was wet and miserable and shivering. I camped at a nearly deserted campsite and the rain pounded on my tent roof all night. In the morning it had pooled on the floor and my things were damp.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85987">On Thursday, the rain never let up. I had just reached highway one around 6pm when the fog rolled in so thick I couldn't see car headlights 50 feet in front of me. My phone told me&nbsp;that there was nothing - no campsites, towns, or gas stations -&nbsp;for at least 20 miles. I wasn't sure what to do. The road followed a steep series of switchbacks and there wasn't a flat place to put my tent. Finally, I found a turn-off that had space large enough to camp.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_85993">Whenever I bush camp by myself, there are a couple of movies that I wish I had never seen. Deliverance is one. The Blair Witch Project is up there also. In fact, in the tree above my tent &nbsp;there was a bit of rope draped in the branches that reminded me of the witchy tree things in that movie. All night I listened to the cars passing on the road next to me and the sound of rain on my tent as I&nbsp;shivered in my wet sleeping bag.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Using Beaglebone Black with Mavericks</title>
      <link>/writing/388</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528bc94e4b009016378ed97/1428733077052//img.jpg" alt=""/>
  

<p>Grrr. I have spent so much time knocking my head against a wall, when the whole time it was just a simple fix.  I even got so frustrated switched over briefly to using my android tablet with a USB OTG, but that was a time-sink because it takes my a long time to program on a tiny keyboard.
Anyway, here's the story.</p>
<p>I started using the Beaglebone Black about two months ago. Everything worked perfectly, and I was impressed with its out of the box functionality. I flashed the latest Debian image, SSH'd into the Beaglebone, installed Python, etc. The world was beautiful.</p>
<p>Then,  a couple days later, I tried to SSH into my Beaglebone, and I couldn't. Just to check, I went through the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/getting-started">getting started</a> steps on the Beaglebone page again. None of them worked! The steps didn't even turn green. I wondered if the drivers might be the problem, so I tried reinstalling them.</p>
<p>I tried the steps <a href="http://waxpraxis.tumblr.com/post/16772215153/talking-to-the-beaglebone-with-osx-10-7-lion">here</a>. They were a little outdated, but I thought they might work. When I went through the beaglebone getting started steps, the first two turned green, but I still couldn't start the web server. I was about to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23318071/beagle-bone-black-not-detected-in-network-interface-on-mac">reset the Pram and SMC</a>, when I saw the fine print on the Beaglebone site:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Older software images require you to EJECT the BEAGLE_BONE drive to start the network. With the latest software image, that step is no longer required."</p></blockquote>
<p>I ejected the beaglebone. I started the network. It worked.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Running Update</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106471">I haven't written about running&nbsp;in a while.
&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106474">That's because I haven't run a race in a while.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106479">The trouble started after my bike trip. I was feeling pretty fit and confident, so I decided to do something that I had considered doing for a while.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106484">I decided to run a half marathon a day for 30 days. Five days in, I started to notice a familiar pain in&nbsp;my IT band. I ran with Club Northwest the first&nbsp;Sunday in May, and halfway into a 16 mile run, my IT band suddenly stopped working. I had to limp the eight&nbsp;miles back to Green Lake. Of course, I was only seven&nbsp;days into my goal at that point, so the next day I ran another half marathon. Then I ran another. And then, in a flash of genius (for me) I quit running and got a physical therapist.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106489">Like I'd been afraid of, my physical therapist Kelly told me not to run for several weeks.&nbsp;Of course I cheated at first, and was met with extreme pain. Then Kelly showed me a way to run by taking extra short steps that increased my cadence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running this way, I was able to do two miles a day without pain. She also gave me a set of exercises that were both helpful for my IT band<em> and</em> a good workout. Having Kelly as my physical therapy was like having a personal trainer and a leg massage &nbsp;twice a week, except that I only had a $10 copay. I highly recommend her and Green Lake Physical Therapy.&nbsp;Gradually, the pain disappeared and by August I was able to run 6 miles at a time.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106497">I even did a pain free 50K in September in 110 degree weather, but that's a different story.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106503">I've increased my weekly mileage gradually this fall, and now I'm doing about&nbsp;40 miles a week. I hope to get to 50 miles a week by the new year, but for the sake of my IT band&nbsp;I'm afraid of overtraining.&nbsp;Having a treadmill in my building helps a lot. I also try to run on Wednesday afternoons with the Seattle Running Club (unofficially, the Amazon Running Club because they're mostly Amazon employees). Then on Sundays&nbsp;at 8am (depending on the night before's activities)&nbsp;I do long runs&nbsp;with Club Northwest. I've run with them three times so far this fall and amazingly I haven't been dropped yet.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106511">The Amazon group is a different story.&nbsp;There are two groups that run at noon from the Amazon buildings. They&nbsp;call themselves 'Least Slow Group' and the 'Less Slow Group.' I normally run with the Less Slow Group, and we clip along at an 8&nbsp;minute&nbsp;pace around Lake Union. But recently, I've been working up to running with the Least Slow Group. They tend to do sub seven minute pace, and I've heard rumors of their killer hill runs. I went for a run with them the week before Thanksgiving. They were doing a loop around Queen Anne, and I asked someone how long it was. "About 8 miles," he told me. We chatted about the Seattle Marathon. The other female runner in the Least Slow&nbsp;Group, Iliana, was doing the marathon on Sunday. I realized that I would be around on Sunday, and figured I should sign up as well.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106516">About 6 miles in, I couldn't keep up with their pace anymore, and they dropped me. I felt a bit discouraged that I couldn't keep up, especially when I reached the Amazon buildings an hour and ten minutes after I started. An hour and ten minutes to run eight miles? What was I doing, thinking of signing up for a marathon? I certainly wouldn't even be close to the front of the pack. If I'm going to pay $140 for a race, I at least want a time that I can be proud of.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_106521">Later that day, I decided to use MapMyRun to see how far the Least Slow Group's Queen Anne Loop was. I carefully mapped my tracks and realized that it was not 8 miles - it was 9.5 miles. An hour and ten to run that wasn't so bad, especially considering the hills at the end. Encouraged, I signed up for the Seattle Half Marathon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A Note About Posterous</title>
      <link>/writing/43</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm still on Posterous, and you can still find my writings and translations (and my bicycle trip) at <a title="http://monicahouston.posterous.com" href="http://monicahouston.posterous.com/">http://monicahouston.posterous.com</a>.

      <title>I Love Pinterest. So?</title>
      <link>/writing/47</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got on facebook in 2006 (back when you had to have a .edu email to sign up) and even though I declared that I hated it at first, I secretly loved it. Same story with Twitter. I signed up shortly after they started, but didn't post a single tweet for two years because I thought it was dorky (I'm kind of glad about this - god knows what I would have tweeted about as a college freshman). But now I am unabashedly sharing my love of Pinterest.
Do you like looking at pictures online? Do you like taking/drawing/making pictures? Do you like looking at magazines but not subscribing to them? I do. Pinterest is a limitless way to share political views, market, buy/sell (yes, you can add price tags to your pins), and of course, share recipes, images of domestic bliss, and fashion plates.</p>
<p>I mentioned to a coworker how much I loved Pinterest.</p>
<p>"Have you noticed how the demographic is 80% female?" he asked. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he meant to say, "have you noticed how the demographic is 80% stupid people?"</p>
<p>"Er," I said, thinking of ways to excuse my gender. It's true though - of the 91 people that I'm following, only 12 are guys. But so what? Even if it is a "girl's club" I still like looking at neatly sorted collections of pictures online. So far, most of my friends seem to be split between posting images of domestic bliss ("Hairstyles I want to try," "Perfect Desserts," "Easy Home D.Y.I") and feminist comics that make fun of images of domestic bliss. Some of girls post both, perhaps evidence of the confusing cultural pull on young women to be both "feminine" and feminist. Can you be both? Of course you can be! And can straight guys use Pinterest? Why the hell not?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Finding A Boat Part 1</title>
      <link>/writing/51</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I've told everyone by now that I want to live on a sailboat, so by popular demand, I'm now going to go over how I plan on doing this.
First of all, I just passed my boater safety test online (necessary for all Washington state boaters under age 30 operating a vessel with 14 horsepower or greater) so congratulations to me. Now there are just a couple of steps left:</p>
<ul>
<li>learn how to sail</li>
<li>hire a boat inspector</li>
<li>look at sailboats with a boat inspector</li>
<li>buy a seaworthy sailboat that meets my requirements (28-36 ft, nice galley, adequate head, comfortable berth)</li>
<li>find a place to moor said boat - probably in Lake Union since they don't allow live-aboard boats on most of Lake Washington</li>
<li>Sail the boat to its new home</li>
</ul>
<p>The only problem is that learning how to sail, finding a boat, and getting moorage are kind of a catch-22. In order to learn how to sail you have to either own a boat or know people who sail. In order to meet people who own boats and know how to sail you have to be part of a yacht club or own your own boat. In order to be part of a yacht club you usually have to own a boat <em>and</em> know other boaters. It also helps to be part of a yacht club in order to get moorage because sometimes there are discounts and other perks.</p>
<p>So somehow I have to meet people who are part of a yacht club. I'm pretty sure that hanging out near the yacht club with a sign that says "Please let me in your club" won't help. Instead, I'm going to hang out in a boat store and accost random people to get them to talk about their boats if they walk near me. I also got a book out of the library about boats that I am going to pretend to read in conspicuous places until somebody who is a boater comes by and sees our common boating interest and talks to me. Or else I'll just wait until July when the Seattle Yacht Club offers sailing lessons to the public...</p>
<p>P.S. - I went to the store to buy myself a plant friend but unfortunately they were out of aloe plants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>West Coast Monica/East Coast Monica</title>
      <link>/writing/52</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been in Seattle for a total of five days now and I haven't quite gotten my head around the concept that this new city that I barely know will be my home for the next year and maybe the longer future. I imagine that perhaps I am just the West Coast version of myself, and there is still and East Coast Monica back in Pennsylvania, doing all of the things East Coast Monica likes to do.
East Coast Monica is taking advantage of the East Coast heat wave and getting a suntan in the backyard, while West Coast Monica flits from coffee house to coffee house, turning paler and paler as she searches for sunshine in a cup of java.</p>
<p>East Coast Monica is still looking for film jobs in Philly, while West Coast Monica has finally discovered that she has a left brain and is in geek heaven browsing the massive Computer Science section in Seattle's public library.</p>
<p>East Coast Monica plays coy, hanging with the friends whom she's known for a hundred years and ignoring strangers who beg for her number (in her imagination). West Coast Monica wanders the streets hoping that she will find another human being to be her friend. Or a stray cat. Or a bug. Even a plant would be nice. I think West Coast Monica is planning on going to the nursery to buy an aloe plant this afternoon.</p>
<p>Someday soon, the two Monicas will have to meet and merge and accept that they are now both West Coast Monica.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to Win Friends and Influence People (when you don't even know your own zip code)</title>
      <link>/writing/62</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might think that a library is a really good place to meet friends, but it isn't. I visited Seattle's main Public Library yesterday - a dizzying structure made of glass and steel - mostly glass. I somehow found my way to the 10th floor through a series of stairs that felt like a rat maze. At the top I looked down over the low railing at the people in the 2nd floor lobby. I felt kind of nauseous. A lady was waiting for the elevator nearby.
"This is a dizzy building," I remarked to her.</p>
<p>"I can't wait to get back to solid ground." She agreed.</p>
<p>"I think I might puke," I said.</p>
<p>But thankfully I didn't. She was the only person I spoke to in the library. Everyone else was too busy reading. I went downtown and talked to the guy in the information booth in front of Pike Place Market. "Hi," I said. "I'm new to Seattle and I don't know anybody and I don't have any idea where I am or what I'm doing."</p>
<p>He took pity on me and gave me all of the Seattle literature and explained the map of Seattle to me in detail. So at least now I have a map.</p>
<p>The library actually isn't the worst place to meet friends. If you stay in your room and read in bed all afternoon like I did today (except for a brief excursion to Whole Foods, where I bought "organic bath tissue") you are guaranteed to not meet anybody. It was great reading-in-bed weather though, and I had stocked up on books at the library.</p>
<p>Now I think I'm going to head downtown because Greyhound just called to tell me to come pick up my box as soon as possible. Apparently the box is leaking strange fluids. Hopefully it's not bike lube. Or art supplies...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Running Clubs of Green Lake</title>
      <link>/writing/66</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things I was most worried about when leaving State College was leaving the <strong>Rec Hall Regulars</strong> running group. How would I be able to find a group of goofy, immature guys (and girls) who run fast enough to push me but don't leave me in the dust?
On Saturday last week I went to my cousin's track meet in Pasco (a tiny town in eastern Washington nestled among sagebrush and velvety grey hills) and my cousin's coach suggested I try <strong>Club Northwest</strong>. They meet Wednesdays and Saturdays for tempo and track workouts, and Sunday mornings for a long run.</p>
<p>Sunday morning I met them at 9am in front of <em>Super Jock and Jill</em> and we did 13.2 miles around North Seattle at a brisk pace. There were about 10 people running, mostly younger guys. Everyone was very friendly and they sold me on the perks of the club - pay a $50 yearly fee and get a free Club Northwest t-shirt, discounts at local running stores including Super Jock and Jill, enter races at a discount, get a free stride evaluation, and get to run cross-country against other clubs. The runners seem to be pretty hardcore and focused on improvement. After the run I lay in bed and ate chocolate the rest of the afternoon and didn't even feel guilty about it (not that I ever feel guilty about it).</p>
<p>Tuesday night I decided to try the <strong>Green Lake Running Group</strong>, which I'd found on meetup.com (seriously, this site is a lifesaver in a new city). They have runs around the lake every day of the week except Sunday, and two track workouts on Mondays. Basically, no matter what time of day you are free there is a run for you, and since there are over 1,000 members you will never have to run alone again. Some of the perks include 10-25% discounts at Road Runner Sports and special First and Third Thursday runs where they drink beer afterwards.</p>
<p>Even though it was raining Tuesday night there were about 15 people there at 6:30pm, and we took off to do three miles or so around Ravenna Park, with an optional extra lap around Green Lake (three miles) at the end. They divided into different pace groups as we ran so that there was something for everybody.</p>
<p>I skipped the tempo run with Club Northwest on Wednesday night and went bouldering instead. Shout out to Max if he's reading this!</p>
<p>Thursday I showed up for Green Lake Running Group's special "Thirdsday" run at Road Runner Sports. They were raffling off running gear so I put my name in the hat.   It was raining again but there were still at least 50 runners meandering around the store. One group took off for a 5 mile 6:40 tempo run. I didn't do that, but I did do a five miler past the Zoo with Tony, another runner from Tuesday. At the end of our five miles we stopped to stretch and chat in front of Green Lake Bar &amp; Grill with the group. It was a smaller group, about 16 people, but very friendly. They asked how we had found their group and we said we'd seen their meetup. "Oh," said Matt, a guy who seemed to be in charge, "we don't get many runners from meetup. Usually people find us on our <a href="http://www.seattleantifreeze.com/">website</a>." "I didn't know you had a website," I said. "Yeah, it's just www.seattleantifreeze.com." He said. I wasn't sure why it had a completely different name, but I didn't ask.</p>
<p>"Where are we drinking?" I asked. "Tacos Guaymas," answered Matt.</p>
<p>At Tacos Guaymas, as we were chatting and sipping our beers and eating our nachos, I asked about the raffle. "When do we find out who won?"</p>
<p>"Raffle?" Asked Lauren, the girl sitting next to me. "What raffle?"</p>
<p>"You know, the Road Runner Sports Raffle...?"</p>
<p>"Uh...I think you ended up with the wrong group."</p>
<p>It was true. We were drinking beers with the <strong>Seattle Antifreeze Runners</strong>. They are part of the greater club, <strong>Seattle Antifreeze</strong>, whose mission is to disprove the "Seattle Freeze" phenomenon (when people from Seattle seem friendly but never call you back). They run on Saturdays and Wednesdays. There's a lot of overlap with the Green Lake Running Group, and they said they also join them for their special Thursday runs.</p>
<p>We had a good laugh. In the end it was a great mistake. Matt, who described himself as "Seattle's biggest social whore" promised to make it his mission to introduce me to as many people as possible, and Lauren invited me to see a Johnny Cash cover band, "Cash'd Out" tomorrow night. Looks like I won't be spending my evenings talking to plants anymore!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Chances Multiply if You Grab Them</title>
      <link>/writing/78</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two paths in life. One can either have friends or one can have a blog. I now have three or even more people in Seattle who I am happy to call my friends because they say things like "we should hang out," or "we should totally get together sometime," or even, "you guys should take Monica rock climbing instead of me because I'm going to be too tired to go." Which is what someone actually said last night when I was out drinking with said friends at a posh hotel called "The Edgewater."
One of these friends, Stark, is a member of the running club that I <a href="/12w82veji45r7e7f1phihhuw1p9xt5/66">accidentally joined</a>, and Saturday morning he had been cleaning up Alki beach for Earth Day with his roommates when he ran into Max walking on a tightrope on the beach. He asked to try the tightrope and somehow both of them realized that they both knew me. Amazing - only a week in Seattle and I'm already known by two people who meet by chance. Which is how I ended up drinking with Stark and friends at The Edgewater Saturday night.</p>
<p>Which is why I woke up at 6:30am on Sunday morning so that I could throw some clothes in a bag and get a ride to Leavenworth. My new friend Stark arrived promptly at 8am to pick me up, an hour after the planned arrival. His friend Pierre, in the front seat, assured me that he's always late because even though he's a rocket scientist he doesn't realize that driving takes time. We met up with five other friends in Ravenna and loaded the gear into the cars (well,<em> they</em> loaded the gear into the cars. What are friends for?). We also took in another passenger, Nathaniel*.</p>
<p>On the two hour drive to Leavenworth we shot the shit about a million topics, ranging from electronic music to Pierre's past involvement in French gangs, to Nathaniel's semi-past involvement in being a geek. The topic turned naturally to sports, and Stark regaled us with his kayaking exploits, such as going over a twelve foot waterfall.</p>
<p>"But it only looked like it was ten feet because there was a lot of foam at the bottom," he said modestly. "Do you still kayak?" I asked, intrigued. "No, I decided that I wanted to devote more time to tubing."</p>
<p>Yes, tubing, a much more hardcore sport. To help him get better, Nathaniel and Pierre drafted a tubing conditioning program for Stark, which included exercises such as floating in his hottub in an inner tube, and perhaps even attempting to hold onto a cooler full of beers with the hottub jets turned on.</p>
<p>Finally we arrived in Leavenworth and drove along Icicle Creek to the climbing area, an outcropping that overlooks the creek and looks up at the snowy peaks of the "Sleeping Lady." After another hour of dilly-dallying, including a trip to the gas station for snacks, we were ready to climb. We grabbed some gear (even me this time) and made our way up the slope to our start point. When I say that "we made our way up the slope" I mean that after wandering around in the brambles for slightly less time than it took Israel to get to the Promised Land we finally found a path to the desired outcropping.</p>
<p>As a Pennsylvanian, even just getting to the foot of the rock face felt higher than I usually go in the chair lift when I'm skiing. I mean, we were looking <em>down </em>at the birds. Not that I'm afraid of heights, I'm just afraid of falling off of them. We were thankfully with our seasoned guide, Mountain Man Matt, so there was nothing, or not much, to be afraid of. Matt and Nathaniel fastened the rope to our first climb. I don't have my own shoes, but thankfully someone had shoes my size, a harness my size, and a helmet that fit my small brain perfectly (my brain is one of my favorite body parts so I choose to protect it).</p>
<p>When it was my turn, I was strapped in and tied up and I started up the rocks as my belayer, Stark, shouted "you're doing great" (I told him to encourage me). There was a ledge, and then a second, steeper rock face. I couldn't get my foot up onto the second face, but thankfully Mountain Man Matt used his brute force to haul me into the air from above (I thought Stark was doing it, but later found out that it was Matt) and I finished the ascent. I scratched my knees up pretty bad while climbing and I'm sorry to say that my days of being a knee model are over.</p>
<p>After that I climbed once more and there was a lot more shooting the shit, eating, and lying around getting a tan before we called it a day and went back to Leavenworth center for delicious Mexican food and beer.</p>
<p>Stark suggested that we all join him in his hottub for some tubing exercises but since tomorrow is my first day of work I decided against it. This is possibly my first wise choice as an adult.</p>
<p>*names in this story have been changed to protect the innocent</p>
<p>P.S. I am drinking tea and I just saw that my tea bag has a quote on it. It says "Chances multiply if you grab them." I like that and I'm going to use it as the title.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>First Day</title>
      <link>/writing/82</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ça y est. Je viens d'y naitre. </em><em>J'sais pas ou je vais, ni ou j'suis, </em>
<em>Mais tous veulent y être.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>That's it. I was just born there. </em>
<em>I don't know where I'm going, or where I am, </em>
<em>but everyone wants to be there. </em></p>
<p>Today was my first day of work. It felt a bit like my first day of school. Grade school. I played games with the other new hires out in the parking lot and ate a lot of snacks. Like, a really lot of snacks. We actually watched a video about work etiquette and not eating a lot of snacks, but I did it anyway. I think I've always been a rebel.</p>
<p>I also sat in a massage chair with controls in Japanese. If you pressed the yellow button and then pressed the button with the sun on it it would massage your whole back, but if you pressed the button with the moon on it it would massage only your butt. That kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, and a great first day. A good day for a fresh start.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bike to Work</title>
      <link>/writing/88</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm on a biking-to-work roll. I have biked every day this week. Because guess what people? May is bike to work month! If you aren't already in on this trend you should start now. Tomorrow is Seattle's official "bike-to-work" day, so just for biking to work I get free donuts and treats. I understand that there will also be some refreshment stations along the Burke Gillman Trail - wait, I just rechecked the stats at <a href="http://blog.cascade.org/category/events/bike-to-work-day/">this blog </a>- there will be OVER 60 refreshment stations set up for those biking to work! Holy bike shorts batman! Check out the map online <a href="http://www.cbcef.org/btw/2012/stationmap.html">here</a>.
My first stop will be Ravenna park, where the Snoqualmie Nordic Club will be holding drawings for some giveaways. Next I'll hit 8050 35th street, where coffee, bike maintenance, &amp; air will be available. Next stop will be 113th St &amp; the Burke Gilman Trail where I can get my trail mix on. I'll ride by the stop at Burke-Gilman Trail &amp; Ballinger Way NE in Lake Forest Park, sponsored by the LFP B.O.O.K. Club. It doesn't say what they're giving away - beer perhaps? Next stop is Logboom Park in Kenmore sponsored by Corpore Sano Physical Therapy &amp; Sports Performance. My final stop will be at the trail behind Cascadia Community College, which offers bike assistance by Bicycles West. I'm not sure what bike assistance is - maybe they'll offer to push me up my final hill?</p>
<p>Wow, this is just another reason that having a twelve mile bike to work is awesome!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Finding a Boat Part 2</title>
      <link>/writing/90</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I have my boater's safety card it's time to move on to steps 1-5 of getting a boat.
<strong>Step 1: Learn how to sail</strong></p>
<p>I've decided that this step doesn't necessarily have to come first. I can live on a boat and learn how to sail it simultaneously. A user poll suggests that if I do this I have only a 50% of crashing and sinking my boat within the first week of owning it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Hire a boat surveyor</strong></p>
<p>I'm working on this right now. It looks like the average cost for a marine survey is $350. I plan to look at some boats on my own first just to rule a few out and when I find one that I like, I will come back with the surveyor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Take boat surveyor to look at boats</strong></p>
<p>I have a couple of boats lined up to look at this weekend. So far I know that I want something 30ish feet that is comfortable to live aboard yet easy for one person to sail. It should have as little outside wood as possible so that I won't have to be constantly staining it and a propane stove.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.5: Apply and Qualify for a Boat Loan</strong></p>
<p>This doesn't seem too difficult, although boat loans are harder to get and have higher interest rate than other loans because there is a greater risk of a boat buyer disappearing with their new boat than there is for, say, a homeowner disappearing with their new home.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Step 4: Find Moorage</strong></strong></p>
<p>This is one of the most complicated steps. I will probably write a more detailed post about this when I actually know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong><strong></strong>Step 5: Buy a Boat</strong></p>
<p>Self-explanatory. As they say, the second happiest day of a boat owner's life is when she buys a boat. The happiest day is when she sells it. At least I'll have something to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>

      <title>How Not to be an Adult</title>
      <link>/writing/97</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really feel like I’ve gotten the hang of being an adult. For instance, I’ve remembered to brush my teeth almost every day this week. Wednesday night I didn’t do anything wild. Instead I looked into boats and boat mortgages for four hours. I was feeling very mature until my Mom sent me an email on telling me how unwise I was to seriously consider pouring my money into a hole in the water. “You need to face that you are addicted to adventure and try and curb it or find other less financially destructive ways to be adventurous.“That’s something to ponder I guess. Is there perhaps a gainful employment for people who are addicted to adventure?</p>
<p>I pondered it for a bit while waiting for Stark to pick me up from Bothell Bike and Ski, where I had taken my bike for a tune-up. While sitting in an Adirondack chair on their front deck of the shop I made a list of boat-buying pros and cons (reasons to buy a boat?<em> I said I would.</em> Reasons not to buy a boat? <em>my Mom told me not to</em>) and did some more math (if I buy a $20,000 boat now will cost me roughly $100,000 over the next 10 years. Does that sound right? Whatever).</p>
<p>Stark and I planned to do an early lap around Green Lake to start planning for <a href="http://seattle.startupweekend.org/">startup weekend</a> on May 18th. Yes, we’re business partners. We plan to invent a way to travel through time while river tubing. And that’s only one of our ideas.</p>
<p>We caught the Seattle Anti Freeze Runners for another lap around Green Lake and then beer. There was a good number of us - maybe fifteen sweaty runners- and we barely fit in the bar.  Nathaniel* from climbing was there, as was Seattle’s Social Whore (Matt objected to the fact that his name was not changed on my blog, so from now on I’ll refer to him as Seattle’s Social Whore, or SSW). I also met the beautiful Salka, the wonderful Allison, and Adrian, who is kind of French. And of course my fellow accidental runner Tony was there.</p>
<p>Somehow we got on the topic of naked races (that may have been my doing. I mentioned that I’d seen a flyer for a nudist race when I was in Road Runner Sports last Thursday). Then the topic turned to skinny dipping, and then somebody joked about jumping in Green Lake, and before I knew it, Stark, Tony, Adrian, Allison and I were standing on the dock by the Green Lake Stadium, removing our sneakers and extra clothes (this is another reason to always wear underpants). Stark bet me a beer that Tony wouldn’t jump in. But Tony tore off his shoes, shouted “what are you all waiting for?” and cannon-balled in. I hopped in after. It was cold. I hopped back out and sprinted several laps around the dock area.</p>
<p>Stark of course had to invite us all back to his apartment’s hot tub so that we could get the full sauna experience. Unlike Sunday night, I accepted the invitation this time. I’d been wise and had a good work ethic for almost four days, so by Thursday I thought I could let my guard down. Also, the trick to being ready for Friday is to start tapering for the weekend on Thursday. It takes some training, but practice makes perfect.</p>
<p>Since Stark now owed me a beer, he was eager to win it back, and he suggested that we make another bet. Through the window of the hot tub room we could see a dedicated, lone runner plugging away on the treadmill. Stark bet me that I couldn’t get her to join us in the hot tub. I was feeling cocky, so I walked into the gym and signalled to her. She took her headphones off and slowed the treadmill down.
“Excuse me,” I said. “Would you like to join us in the hot tub? I just made a bet that you would.”
“Uh, ok,” she said. “I’m training for a marathon so I need to do five more miles, but I can come in for a bit.”
“Thank you! You deserve it. It’s very refreshing and great for sore muscles.”</p>
<p>Stark was too amazed at first to realise that he’d lost the bet. He just sort of sat and stared with his mouth open as the runner took her shoes off and got in. She was very friendly (I had gotten lucky) and mentioned that since she moved here from Vancouver she hadn’t found a good running club. So of course, we invited her to Saturday morning’s run in Queen Anne. So now Stark owes me two drinks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Seattle Half Marathon</title>
      <link>/writing/393</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94568">I hadn't run a half marathon distance since my unfortunate half marathons in May, so I had no idea how fast I could run one. I extrapolated, based on recent runs, what I could expect my time to be. Anything under 1:35 and I could be happy, I decided. The girl last year had won in 1:24. I thought that might be my&nbsp;stretch goal.
&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94571">I was surprisingly nervous the day&nbsp;before the race. In July, I had&nbsp;a pair of New Balance running shoes that I loved, but which had unfortunately not lasted very long, partially because I wore them once while climbing sharp, barnacle covered rocks by the sea. &nbsp;They were super minimalist - more like socks with a bit of tread on the bottom than shoes really. You could literally roll them up and put them in your purse. They also glowed in the dark.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94576">I searched for them in two different stores before learning that they had been discontinued. Thankfully, I found a fairly similar pair at NikeTown and bought those.</p>
  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6aee4b0a8996a246b67/1428727525354/WP_20141130_09_30_05_Pro.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6aee4b0a8996a246b67/1428727525354/WP_20141130_09_30_05_Pro.jpg" alt="WP_20141130_09_30_05_Pro"/></a> WP_20141130_09_30_05_Pro[/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94582">I had to pick up my race packet from the Westin that evening, and I wandered around taking freebies. Then I went home and ate some Indian food, drank a couple of screw drivers, worked for a bit, listened to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKxzcAoxcdo">hypnosis for athletic performance</a>, and went to bed&nbsp;around 11pm (I'm mostly writing this for my benefit so that next race I have I can look back and imitate this. Especially the screw driver drinking part). I had set my alarm for 6:45, but then I realized that if I woke up and discovered that my bike was stolen I would have to take the bus, so instead I set my alarm for 6:30.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94590">I'm glad I set my alarm for 6:30, because I had forgotten that I'd left my bike at WeWork the Monday before Thanksgiving, and never picked it up. &nbsp;My Uber app wasn't working (and I don't know if I want to support Uber anymore anyway) so I had to take Tony's bike. There was no&nbsp;time to adjust the seat so it was way to big for me. I also didn't figure out how the gears worked for a while, so I was stuck in the lowest gear. It's only a 10 minute ride to Seattle Center, where the race was starting, from the condo, but when I got there I only had 15 minutes until the race start at 7:30. I couldn't figure out how to get into the corral with the racers. When I finally did, they were counting down four minutes to go. I rudely shoved my way through the crowd. With one minute to go, I caught sight of the 1:30 pacers at the front of the pack. I was going to follow them no matter what. And we were off.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94595">The first half felt almost easy. I was running with my head up and my legs were loping along under me. It was fun to run on the closed down highway and through the tunnels. On the other side of the tunnel, Lake Washington was absolutely beautiful, sparkling a cold blue. I had been&nbsp;thinking the night before about what it means to run 'for yourself' and this was it. There aren't a lot of things I do just for myself. Writing is one of them.&nbsp;Sailing is another. Tinkering with arduino is another. Running is another.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94600">Around mile 7, the course got hilly again. I'm not great at hills. Another girl caught up to me. A girl from the front of the race fell back. There were now three girls running around the 1:30 pace group, and we were oddly all wearing teal jackets. I mentioned it, laughing, and the pacer&nbsp;asked,&nbsp;"Did you all call each other this morning to coordinate your outfits?"</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94605">Around mile nine we all started to spread out. I fell back from the pacers. One of the girls stayed with them, and one stayed just ahead of me. My legs were starting to feel tired. I was glad about this, and also surprised. In the past when I've run, my lungs have always tired before my legs. Making your legs stronger is easy. Lungs are harder to exercise.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94610">I kept reminding myself to smile. Smiling when running is an amazingly effective performance enhancing drug. It should probably be made illegal.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94615">I kept considering taking my jacket off and running in a sports bra, but given the 30 degree weather, it never seemed like a good idea. Finally, I saw the sign for mile 12. Whenever I'm running and it gets tough, I tell myself 'Just one more mile. You can do anything for a mile." Also it was a downhill mile. I caught up to one of the teal jacket girls and passed her.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94620">When racing, I have a bizarre downhill form that is probably extremely damaging to my body, but extremely effective. It's how I originally hurt my IT band. This race, my IT band was fine, but my right calf started to cramp up. Only half a mile to go! Even if my calf cramped up now, I could still run to the finish so I didn't care.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94625">Only a quarter mile. You can do anything for a quarter mile. Only 0.2 miles. At 0.1 miles, I broke into a sprint to the finish. I crossed in 1:32:20.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94631">Someone put a medal around my neck. I was handed a space blanket and a protein bar. I looked at the protein bar blankly. The last thing on my mind was eating food.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94636">There was a sunny spot on the bleachers&nbsp;in the recovery area.&nbsp;A guy in an orange shirt was sitting there wearing a space blanket. I recognized him. We had run together the whole way, and he had finished a couple seconds ahead of me. We chatted for a bit. We had both been shooting for sub 1:30 times but hadn't quite made it. It wasn't a PR for him. It was for me. It was a 10 minute PR in fact. He encouraged me to find a coach. "At 26 you're just getting started with distance running. In a couple of years you'll reach your peak. I'll look for your name in future races." He also told me to check to see if I'd won anything, since he'd only seen a couple of girls in front of us.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428728818567_94641">I hadn't won anything - just 5th place in my age group&nbsp;which means that my name shows up on the "Leaders" page of the Seattle Marathon Results, so I'm pretty content. Maybe next time if I start practicing I can win. Speaking of winners, Iliana of the Least Slow&nbsp;Group took fifth overall in the marathon, which is seriously awesome. I hope to grow up to be as fast as her.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 6</title>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_108735">I’m writing this as I feed my fire. There is an odd combination of analog, digital, and stone age technology that is present in my campsite. I wish that I had an illuminated keyboard on my tablet so that I could type faster. Also, I wish that I had a spoon. Have you ever gotten most of your hand stuck in a jar of Nutella? </p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_108738">I didn’t get very far today. There was a headwind. My bike felt heavier than ever. The mile markers were farther apart also. The headwind blew sand in my hair, which became itchy under my helmet. I passed through a tiny town called Reedsport, about halfway to my intended destination of Coos Bay. There were some random motels and a Dairy Queen, where I decided to stop and get some mountain dew and a pastry.&nbsp;Yesterday I had eaten that same combination at a little country store&nbsp;around 150 miles in, and it had given me an amazing energy boost. I was needing that again today. It surprised me to see that it was already 4pm. I hadn’t started until almost 2pm, but I was still only going about 10 miles per hour.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_108743">I&nbsp;skyped my parents and told them about yesterday’s ride. Mom scolded me for not taking a rest day. “Just because you CAN ride 180 miles doesn’t mean you have to do it every day. You look exhausted.”</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_108748">She had a point. I picked out a campsite about 6 miles south at a state park called Umqua Lighthouse State Park. I could make it there in time to take a shower, set up my tent, organize my things, and watch the sun set over the Pacific from the lighthouse point before making a fire and writing about my day.</p>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 2</title>
      <link>/writing/303</link>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164087">
I woke up on Tuesday morning knowing that I had 140 miles ahead of me. I dreaded it slightly,&nbsp;since I expected the same scenery (or lack of scenery) as yesterday - just 60 miles more of it. Also, the sun was gone and it looked like possible rain.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164092">I did the first 30 miles in under two hours, despite my heavy paniers. I took an hour break in the Centralia library to charge my phone and figure out which paths to take.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164097">I knew that it was going to be a long time on a bike by myself, but I hadn't expected the feeling of loneliness. The countryside that I was riding through was desperate and unpeopled. My neck was crooked from fighting the wind. To pass the time, I listened to the Chinese tapes my Mandarin tutor had given me.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164102">"Listen and Repeat," the English voice said, and I dutifully repeated words.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164107">"Please say it again."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164112">"Qing&nbsp;zai shuo yi bian."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164117">I listened to all of the conversations, and then I listened to them again. And again.&nbsp;I wasn't really paying attention. I was in a meditative state, and I repeated the words like a thousand mantras. My Bluetooth earbuds died, and I put them back in my pack to charge. I felt like I was starting to die also. The headwind was strong, the bike was heavy, and the hills were long. My rear shifter stopped working and my bike was stuck permanently on the highest gear. I couldn't fix it. I drank some hammer gel, spilling the sticky brown&nbsp;goop on my shorts and my face. I was getting sick of the flavour, but it gave me the will to ride on.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164122">I crossed under and over I5 and considered hitchhiking the rest of the way to Portland. 80 miles in, I saw signs for&nbsp;a coffee stand. I didn't want to stop before I crossed to Oregon, but I really wanted a coffee. I stopped and went back to the stand. I asked for the richest thing they had. The barista suggested a coffee with chocolate and vanilla fudge and whipped cream. That sounded excellent. I sat down to eat it at the nearby picnic table. Sitting down, I realized how tired I was, and how late it was. It was almost 4pm and I still had 64 miles to go. At that moment, I gave up. I had a white trash bag and a pen, and I made a sign that said "Portland." I would go sit by I5 and wait for some serial killer to pick me up.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164127">I slowly got up and walked to my&nbsp;bike. "Do you want me to fill that up for you? Asked the barista, gesturing to my water bottle." She took it from me and filled it, explaining to her friend, who had just arrived, that I was doing a trip from Seattle to San Francisco.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164132">"How much farther do you have to go today?" Asked her friend.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164137">"60 miles, but I don't know if I'll make it," I admitted.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164142">"You got this," said the barista and gave me a huge smile and my full waterbottle.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164147">And with her smile and encouragement, I got back on my bike,&nbsp;put away my sign,&nbsp;and rode over the Lewis and Clark Bridge. Never, ever ride over the Lewis and Clark Bridge on a bicycle. Although it doesn't expressly forbid bicycles, there is a sign before the bridge that says "end bike lane." Indeed the bike lane ends. There is a 3 foot margin on the side of the road filled with pieces of lumber, trash and hubcaps. Semis carrying oversized loads of logs headed down the coast whoosh by you at 60 miles per hour as you try to keep your balance while riding over chunks of gravel and wood that have fallen off previous trucks. And then you get to the top of the bridge, and you wish you could take a picture but you have to keep moving or lose your balance.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164152">And then you're in Oregon.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164157">I should have been glad. The sign said 48 miles to Portland and I was 2/3rds done with my trip. I just had to continue along highway 30. I continued. My legs didn't hurt, but there was a leaden quality to my whole body. I coasted along the Colombia River. My palms, under their gloves,&nbsp;were red from grasping the handle bars, and my crotch was sore from the saddle. I was determined to get within 20 miles of the city. Then I could see if there was a bus that I could take the rest of the way.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164160">23 miles from Portland, I sat down to eat the rest of the nutella. I sat and I sat. Sitting by the side of the road felt so good. It was 7pm. Once again, the sun was going down. A car did a U-turn and pulled over to make sure I was ok. I smiled and waved them on. But I couldn't get up. I remembered the power of the encouraging words that morning, and I called Tony to see if he could encourage me. I was also worried my couchsurfing host would be pissed at me for arriving so late. So I decided, at last, to hitchhike. There was no public transportation this far outside the city, and the taxi company I tried calling refused to go that far either.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164165">I stood by the side of the road with my sign. My bike was lying in a pile behind me. I figured I looked pitiful enough. I decided to try smiling at people. But nobody stopped. 50 cars passed and nobody stopped. Finally, about to give up, I turned around and saw a little blue car backing up towards me.&nbsp; A mom and her&nbsp;preteen&nbsp;daughter were coming home from a track meet and I could tell they were giddy about the adventure of picking up a hitchhiker for the first time. They helped me to fit my bike in the car (it just fit) and agreed to drive me to Portland, which happened to be completely out of their way.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164170">We talked for a bit, and then turned up the music when we ran out of nice things to say. I sat, completely exhausted, on their comfortable seats.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164175">Not only did they drive me to Portland - they bore with my navigational errors that landed them on the northeast side of Portland when I was trying to go to the northwest side. She refused to let me off until we actually found the exact address that I was staying at.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164180">And after chauffeuring me across half of Portland, she refused to take any money for her efforts.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_164185">Whoever you are, thank you!!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Prioritize.</title>
      <link>/writing/103</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, the line between insanity and boredom is about as thin as dental floss. Ever since I added my facebook events to my Google calendar (it's actually very simple - just go to your Facebook events page, click the magnifying glass, click "export events" and copy the link that pops up, then go to Google calendar and where it says "other calendars" just paste the link) my calendar has so much overlap that it looks a bit like a Mondrian. If I miss an event or barely make it, this can leave me feeling over scheduled, double-booked, and burned out. At the same time, if I actually do fulfill all of my obligations I feel energized, fulfilled and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c">like a boss</a>. And since this is such a good feeling, I continue to overbook myself. If I have two or three events in the same block of time I get kind of stuck and waste time deciding which one to attend.
I’ve always been sort of a jack of all trades (master of none), but I’ve decided to prioritize my life for the month of May so that I can get better at just a few things. So here is my priority list:</p>
<p>My number one priority is work. I am so lucky to have my job and I want to do great work. Getting to work relatively well-rested (5+ hours of sleep) and on time every day is non-negotiable.
My number two priority is sailing. This weekend is opening day for most of the local yacht clubs, and I also have several sailboats booked to look at. I’ve decided that if there is a sailing event and another event, the sailing event will always take priority. I feel very fortunate to have met the wonderful sailors at the Corinthian Yacht Club and I want to make sure that I don’t come across as a flake by bailing on any events. I also want to devote at least half an hour each day to learning more about sailing.
My number three priority is running, although I’m not sure that this counts as a priority, since I think running is a necessity like eating or sleeping. I’m counting it as a priority, however, because I want to run more than just maintenance this month so that I can get ready for the Rothrock Challenge. If I have to make a choice between running and going out, running will come first (unless it’s my off-day).
My number four priority is socializing and networking. This one is really going to be a challenge (not!).
My number five priority is learning to code. Unfortunately, I’m already lagging behind in my <a href="http://www.cs101-class.org/">computer science course</a>, and apparently there are new code academy lessons that I haven’t even seen yet. I should designate time to this on my calendar each day to make sure that it actually gets done. I’m kind of up in the air about whether this should come after socializing or not, but since this is my third week in Seattle and I want to forge some good friendships I think I’ll leave it as priority 5.</p>
<p>Now that I have my priorities set out, I can color-code my calendar events accordingly so that I know which overlapping event takes precedence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle Nightlife</title>
      <link>/writing/131</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>And now for something completely different. I'm a bit tired from Startup Weekend. I asked my coworker, Scott Bays, to guest-write a piece about our adventures in Seattle last weekend. Expect more Startup Weekend related posts in the week to come, but for now, let me present Seattle nightlife..</em>
Seattle nightlife...</p>
<p>It has always been considered subpar compared to the nightlife of many other metropolitan areas.  You wouldn’t think this of the famous “sleepless” city of music.  It could be said that 90% of the population here knows how to have a great time in some fashion, but perhaps only 10% actually know where to have a great time when it comes to the night and what comes after.</p>
<p>This was my task.  Monica’s friend Adan, from college, was applying for a job at Microsoft and was only here for a night.  They gave him a powerful Dodge Charger to drive, and Monica wanted to show him Seattle.  She knew I was into the nightlife a bit and had hyped up venues before, so she trusted me to be the guide for this night.  Getting pretty into it, I probably went through about three or four starting places to sit down, relax, and enjoy a drink or two before going to the party. She honorably took the blame for the locale changes however, which I found humorous enough to let it be. The first place I chose for the evening:  Bathtub Gin &amp; Co., a Belltown legendary bar and hangout place.  I had never been there, but heard amazing stories from pretty much everyone so I felt it was a good choice regardless and I would get a chance to try it.  10:00pm was our meetup time, and so the story begins...</p>
<p>It actually begins with a homeless man.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>9:50 comes around and I’ve located the elusive bar.  I text Monica some directions to the best parking lot to use and sit down to wait. No response by a little after 10pm so I decided to go ahead and call. No answer.</p>
<p>“You seem like you are spacing out a bit man.” A homeless man walks up to me while I’m leaning up against the wall of a building. “Girl not answering?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, not sure if my friends stood me up or not yet, so maybe.” I glance at the sign he is carrying that has “BEER ME!” written on it. I also notice the belt holsters carrying four beers in them, so it is definitely working out well for him.  “Nice sign!” I laugh. He laughs as well, and for a homeless man; he really doesn’t smell all that badly.</p>
<p>He goes on to tell me stories of Karma. Of people having accidents, or fortune, and all the karma related things involved in his life. They are actually pretty interesting stories, and I’m waiting anyway, so I nod my head and listen.   Some of them are also quite hilarious, so I give him five dollars out of the cash I prepared for the night.</p>
<p>“Let me rub some of my good karma off on you.” He says as he rubs his elbow on my shirt. I raise an eyebrow to this homeless man who is giving me karma. “Now try calling, she’ll pick up.”</p>
<p>By this time it is about 10:30, and I give Monica another call.  After a few rings, she actually picks up!  “What time is it?” She asked. Turns out she had a bit longer of a nap than intended.  I laugh and yell back at the homeless guy while Monica is still on the phone. “What is your name, man?”</p>
<p>“They call me Shadow.” He yells back. I nod my head in approval, as this sounds like it is straight out of a novel to me so I am already quite pleased with the evening.</p>
<p>I get off the phone with Monica so she can call Adan, and she texts me to let me know they are going straight to See Sound. This is the name of the club we were going to go to after drinking/meeting at the bar. I walk over there and listen to the music a bit. It’s not really to my liking, so I text her back a fallback plan for the first club. Let’s go to Trinity first instead, and give her the address. By the time I arrive they are already there, and the night finally begins.</p>
<p>Trinity is Club. Pretty much what you would expect out of a club. Nothing amazing, nothing awful, just good standard Top-40s with a couple of branched off areas that play perhaps some dubstep or hip hop. Can’t really go wrong.  I get a drink, join Adan and Monica who are already into it, and start dancing. We did take a couple of breaks from the dancing to go upstairs and sit so I can actually meet Adan (even though this is quite difficult in a loud club of course). I also text some of my friends that are out to find out what they are doing. We get into a short sparring match over texts as they try to get me to come over to them and I try to get them to come over to us. All-in-all it didn’t really matter, Adan had already bought Monica and I another drink so we continue the fun.</p>
<p>Monica ended up meeting another girl there named Christie. They danced together, and Adan and I went to the other side of the dance floor.</p>
<p>Eventually the club started clearing out around 2:00am.  Monica mentions that she believes we're going to someone’s house.  We meet a few new people including the owner of another club who says he's having an after party. Monica asks him about her friends joining.  He turns to his friends and complains how he “doesn’t want a bunch of random people at his house.”  Of course you don’t want her male companions to be with her to make sure she stays safe tonight...asshole...</p>
<p>One of the friends, a shorter black guy was actually quite cool; I don’t remember his name however.  He kept trying to convince this guy that we were cool to chill out with them, but he wouldn’t have it. Christie at this time started walking off so Monica rushed after her. In the end, we decided to go to Noc Noc and quickly bailed from the situation.</p>
<p>A quick background of Noc Noc. This is the place. I was unsure about bringing both Monica and Adan here originally, as I have always gone with a group of friends that were well prepared for the night. This was my first time taking people, one of them I just met and it was my first outing with Monica as well. Noc is, during the evening, an 80s bar with a goth style.  However, on Friday nights and Saturday nights (Or rather 2:00am Saturday and 2:00am Sunday), it transforms into the greatness that is Noc Noc. At that time it turns into an EDM dance club where local DJs will come and mix some amazing music until the morning.  An after-hours club.  I have actually never been to the evening portion of it, nor do I actually ever plan on it. This iteration of Noc is the one I know and love, the 2:00am sorts. But it’s not for everyone. Still, all four of us were pretty in sync and were ready to continue the night.  So we walked there.</p>
<p>Or actually, a couple of blocks in Christie was complaining about the walk because of her shoes.  Adan picks her up and carries her on his back while she humorously calls him playful names that I’ll leave out from here. She also told me I should be carrying Monica.  Psh, yeah right. If I tried to pick up and carry Monica I would probably be the one that somehow ended up getting carried instead. (<em>editor's note: are you calling me fat?)</em></p>
<p>Once we reached Noc we got in the line that is usually present on these after-hours. By the time we paid our cover Dave, the promoter, was watching the line. I go up to him to say hi. Honestly, I wasn’t sure if he would remember me without the rest of the group I usually come with since so many people go through Noc all the time. Not only did he recognize me he also knew the amount of time it’s been since I had last been there. I introduced him to the other three and let him know that Monica and Adan are fresh from PA. “Show them how it’s done!” He slapped me on the back and we went inside.</p>
<p>80% amazing people,10% creepers, 10% shady people.  That’s Noc for you. People from all walks of life end up in there dancing together. And everyone has fun.  Now in Washington, alcohol can’t be served from 2:00-6:00am. Thus, the only refreshments at this time is water and red bull.  But this is fine! Drunk people cause problems, people at Noc; not usually so much. Music was amazing at this time, which I later found out from a friend that one of his favorite DJs just happened to be there the night Monica and I went.  Christie ran into another guy that she was dancing with at Trinity, and they ended up leaving early. That would be the last we ever heard from her. At some point in time I realized there were a few people I recognized that went outside, so I followed them to chat for a while.</p>
<p>This is the only unfortunate part of the evening. Apparently while I was outside Monica had met another group of people and placed her purse under a girl named Nicky’s coat. It ended up getting stolen...Luckily she didn’t have too much in her purse, and we searched the place a bit to see if they just took the cash and left the rest in a trash bin. No luck. Looks like Monica will end up getting a new phone sooner than she thought. I always teased her about how bad her phone was anyway. Still,  Monica seemed to be having so much fun she didn’t even really care, so we just kept at it.</p>
<p>Adan and I also got some time at the bar where we chatted about various topics (mostly women). He’s a pretty cool guy, I decided. Thrust right into this but having an amazing time of it, glad I got to show it to him and I really hope he gets the job so we can all do it again sometime!</p>
<p>We ended up leaving Noc and hanging out with the friends that Monica had met there, including Nicky. That’s usually how it happens at Noc. You go there with friends, and end up with more friends. We went to a place called 5 Points Cafe. This cafe has been open 24/7 since the 1930s. It never closes. Even on holidays. There we chatted about neurology, anarchism, and all sorts of fun Seattlite things like that.   Eventually we realized that it was about time for the morning to end, as Adan had a flight to catch at to go back home.</p>
<p>He gave Monica and me a ride in his charger, we helped him load his things from the hotel, and he dropped us at my place so he could rush to the airport. Things got a little tricky at this point in time, as my house tends to have a lot of people over on Friday night, thus all my roommates were completely passed out. So to return Monica back home I found the nearest bus route and joined her. She had already given up on her early morning run at this time since it was nearing 11:00am. But she still had other day activities coming up because she is always busy so she had to get back to her place. I went along and we had a pretty epic bus conversation in the meantime. After she made it home, we went our separate ways.</p>
<p>Now I can say, welcome to Seattle.</p>
<p><em>(thanks Scott!)</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Build a Website in One Week with Codacademy</title>
      <link>/writing/221</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mom asked me a very good question - "How long will it take to learn to code in Codeacademy?"
Codeacademy started fall of 2011 with just a handful of lessons, and new lessons are being added weekly. Coding, like sailing, seems to be one of those things that you could spend your entire life learning. In fact, January of last year, codeacademy started a plan called "Code Year" where you could reasonably get through every single lesson in a year by making weekly progress (and still keep your friends and your full-time job). Fingers crossed that they'll do it again this January!</p>
<p>But how long will it take before you can build your first website using what you learn on Codeacademy? Even if you have zero experience you can build a site within one week.</p>
<p>By doing just 5 exercises a day you can get through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/html-one-o-one">"HTML Fundamentals"</a> and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/week-3-html-project/0">"Build your First Web Page"</a> in six days. In order to make the most out of Codeacademy, I recommend that you have a <strong>goal</strong>. For instance, wanting to build your own portfolio site could be a goal. Having a concrete goal will make Codeacademy more than a game - it will help you to connect what you're learning to the actual practice of building websites in the real world.</p>
<p>Draw a layout of the website that you want to build on paper or mock it up in Photoshop or Gimp if you want to be fancy. For the first version, just focus on creating the text that you want to display when you open the page with a browser (we'll get into "hosting" sites in a later lesson.) For instance, your first website's code could look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lt;html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt; Monica Houston's Portfolio &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h2&gt;Everything is better on a boat&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Monica Houston and I live on a boat...yada yada yada&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h3&gt; follow or friend me here&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;http://twitter.com/houstonconsult&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;http://www.behance.net/Mhouston&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/houstonmonica&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;http://www.codecademy.com/users/zebular13&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;li&gt;https://github.com/zebular13&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/html&gt;</p></blockquote>
<p>Write your code into a text editing program like text-edit or notepad and save it as something like "index.html." Right click and open it with your browser. BAM! You've made your first real web page!</p>
<p>So how do you make it pretty? Codeacademy has an entire series of courses on CSS - the language that is used to style HTML. I'll go over resources for learning CSS in my next post, but for now I'll leave you with this useful video:</p>

      <title>Hagg Lake 50K</title>
      <link>/writing/289</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have to put the word "tough" as in "tough mudder" in the name of your race, your race by definition is not tough. If you're looking for tough, go with something that has a name that is the name of the location plus the distance; preferrably a distance in the double or triple digits.
Torrential rains were coming down on Saturday, the morning of the Hagg Lake 50K. I was planning to run the race with Tony, but he had bailed on me because he got sick a few days before. To be fair, he had never really agreed to go on the race in the first place. I had signed him up and bought him a ticket while he was out of the country. I'm pretty sure he was faking his illness. Thankfully, I got a substitute - Zach Buchanan, to make an appearance with one day's notice.</p>
<p>I didn't want to run the whole thing alone, but transferring the ticket was illegal, so I warned Zach beforehand that if anyone asked, he was Tony. I didn't warn him that much beforehand, because Zach had overslept, so we got there about 5 minutes after the actual start. This wasn't a huge deal in a race that takes 4-9 hours.</p>
<p>It was pouring so hard that I didn't even want to get out of the car, and I had visions of driving back to Portland and spending a relaxing weekend in bed. But then I thought of the carb loading I had done the night before and decided to get out of the car.</p>
<p>I hurried to pin the number to my pants and Zach and I raced after the distant crowd. The first lap was up a nice, gravel hill. We sped up it, passing tons of people. On the way down, Zach told me that the furthest he had ever run was 8 miles. He also described his brutal training regime which consisted of a standing desk and an exercise ball that he bounced on while training (there may have been some basketball, climbing, a 22 mile bicycle commute every day, and various century rides mixed in there somewhere as well). My training regime had not been very running heavy either. It mostly consisted of doing Yoga X every other day and running 4-5 miles on the weekend.</p>
<p>After the brief up and dowhill came the race around the lake. This is where the mud comes in. The website mentions mud, but the race itself isn't really billed as a mud run. The pictures from last year show smiling runners running on dry paths under sunny skies. The torrential rains this year changed all that. Zach was sliding around like a kid learning to skate.</p>
<p>One of our fellow runners noticed. "Nike Frees, huh? That might not have been the best choice today." It turns out that this guy worked for a shoe store and was wearing some practical trail running shoes. "You're going to have a tough time in those, son." He left this parting advice as he sped past us at the aid station.</p>
<p>As we continued past the second aid station, I started to notice that Zach was talking less and less. I asked him what he recommended doing in Portland for the weekend. "Can we talk about this another time? I need to concentrate on not falling down." I turned around and realized that he was covered in mud and not looking too good. "Did you run the whole way when you did 50 miler?" "No, I walked a lot." "Ok, because maybe we should walk soon."</p>
<p>Hint taken. It was getting harder and harder for me to lift my legs too. We were no longer in ankle deep mud - this was more like the mire that John Bunyan speaks of in Pilgrim's Progress. "Why did you tell me these shoes would be ok?" Zach asked. I had told him the shoes would be ok mostly because I was in a hurry and half asleep. I thought of the greek myth of Atalanta and began to wonder if running was an externalization of my misandry. "Do I run because I hate men and I want to see them fail?" I wondered. "Or am I more like Hippomenes, sabotaging my opponents so that they can't beat me?"</p>
<p>So far it was two for two. Brad had dropped out at mile 17 of the 50 miler after I fed him the 4Loko (to be fair, I had drunk half the can myself and then gotten lost and run a bit extra on that race).</p>
<p>Zach declared that he was dropping out just past the third aid station. He wanted to finish at least the 25K though, and he did.</p>
<p>The worst thing about the Hagg Lake 50K is that it's two 25K laps. So the first lap is a little bit muddy, but the second lap has already been trampled twice so it is REALLY muddy. The rains kept pouring and the day was getting colder, not warmer. My shirt was soaked. My shoes were soaked but I no longer felt them. All I cared about now was passing as many people as possible to get the highest place possible. This wasn't hard. By the second lap, many people were run-walking. As I passed each one, I smiled and said "Great job! keep it up!" In my head I was thinking "See ya later sucker!"</p>
<p>On ultramarathons, I realize that you play a lot of mind games with yourself to keep running. Most of the ones I play are fairly evil and reveal a sadistic tendency. Often, other runners comment on my nice smile. "Still smiling at mile 21! Keep it up!" They yell. But I'm not necessarily smiling because I'm happy. Instead it's because I want to win, and I feel less pain when I'm smiling. I also like to let out a little happy sigh, as if I'm having the best time of my life. This is to discourage the runners around me.  I imagine them thinking "if there are other runners that are still enjoying this, I am f#$cked." Whenever I pass another runner, I try to put as much distance between them and me as possible. This is because there is nothing worse than being passed by someone who you just passed.</p>
<p>My mantra for the Hagg Lake run was "I've had periods that hurt worse than this." Everytime I passed a male runner I thought this and laughed maniacally in my head.</p>
<p>The last 4 miles were the worst. I passed the aid station at 26.8 and thought "I've already run over a marathon. What's left is nothing." But it wasn't nothing. As I passed a runner at mile 26.81, I smiled at him and said "Nice work! Almost there!" I heard him grunt behind me.  I found myself paying attention to the scenery during this last bit. I remembered landmarks from the first lap, but now it seemed as if everything had been stretched, so what took 5 minutes on the first lap now took 20 minutes. At mile 29.5 I passed one last runner. I could hear him behind me, jogging, then walking. By now there was a lot of walking going on. Whenever I walked up a hill, I worried that he would pass me, but he never did. When I slowed, he slowed.</p>
<p>Just before the finish was the parking lot where Zach and my friend Deborah were waiting in the car. They rolled down the window as I hobbled up to them. "Cheer for me!" I begged them "I need it!" They did cheer and Zach honked the horn. I staggered past them and through the last bit of mud to the finish line. There it was. The other runner was still behind me. We ran through the finish line, high fived and hugged. Now the race was over and we were friends. We jogged straight down the hill from the finish line into the lake. Ahhh! Ice bath. We stood up to our waists in the freezing lake with four other runners, smiling and laughing at the surrealness of it all.</p>
<p>The other runners had run the 50K before and they both agreed that this had been the toughest race ever because of the absurdly muddy conditions.</p>
<p>When I exited the lake I was given a medal and a foil blanket. The fast shoe store guy who had passed us earlier saw me in the tent and congratulated me. I had somehow managed to pass him and he had finished just after me. I ate some soup and stood by the space heaters but I couldn't stop shivering. I hadn't thought to bring towels or warm clothes and I dreaded the quarter mile walk back to the car.  Next year though, I will be prepared. Zach had better be also.</p>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Day 11</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="274.0"]<a href="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6ade4b0a8996a246b1f/1428727520235/day11.jpg" ><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54fcde57e4b07e462fdd69b4/5528a6ace4b0a8996a246af1/5528a6ade4b0a8996a246b1f/1428727520235/day11.jpg" alt="day11"/></a> day11[/caption] 
  

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65548">
I was in a black mood on Friday morning, and the skies were even blacker and rainier. I was so damp and cold and I hadn't slept the night before. I had left my U-lock sitting behind&nbsp;my tent, and&nbsp;the U piece was no longer there. I guess that it had been washed down the hill the night before, but had no intention of looking for it.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65553">I also had nothing to eat but hammer gel. Even after not eating for 12&nbsp;hours, the taste was still repulsive. I'm never going to get the espresso flavor again. Nokia maps told me that there was a town, Rockport, in 20 miles. I could feel myself drooling, anticipating buying breakfast food. But when I got there the sign said "No Services." The next town, Westport, was another 10 miles away. I used every mental trick I had to get over the next hill. I imagined that my bicycle was a horse, and my legs were actually the horse's legs. I cursed at myself like a drill sergeant. In the end, I got off my bike and walked it up the last bit of hill. Then I coasted down the 7% grade for four miles.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65558">There was the coast. And it was beautiful.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65563">What is it about riding along the coast? I don't think it's the wind, and it's certainly not the hills that Highway 1 offers. But there's something about hearing the waves crashing into the cliffs below that makes my spirits rise and my legs move faster.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65568">Westport didn't have any restaurants, but it had a General Store that doubled as the Post Office, deli, and hangout spot. &nbsp;I went in and grabbed a coffee. &nbsp;The lady behind the counter looked at me and said,&nbsp;"Aww, honey."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65573">"Stay here as long as you want," she told me. "We have a hand-dryer in the bathroom. You can go in there and turn it on you until you're dry." I stayed there for an hour, drying out, warming up, drinking hot coffee, and chatting with the clerks.&nbsp;By the time the hour was up, the rain had nearly let up. By Fort Bragg, the sun was out. I stopped at the bike store to get some wet lube (a pessimistic purchase, but it served me well). Then&nbsp;I kept going. As long as it wasn't raining I wanted to cover as many miles as possible. I still had 200 to go before San Francisco. Around 2pm, the wind started up. But this time, it was at my back. When the wind is at your back it feels like you're flying.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65578">In a little town called Elk I saw another cyclist sitting by herself eating a sandwich outside of a store. I bought some peanuts and joined her. She had just quit her job also, she told me, and was traveling to figure out what was next.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65583">Another girl suddenly came over. "Excuse me, can I ask you a question?" She asked.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65586">"Sure," I said."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65589">"Where are you coming from? Are you Bicycling the Pacific Coast?"</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65592">Me and the other cyclist looked at each other. "I started in Astoria," said the other&nbsp;cyclist. "Me in Seattle," I said.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65595">"So you're doing the <em>Bicycling the Pacific Coast&nbsp;</em>Route?" Asked the stranger.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65601">"Yes," said the cyclist.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65604">"What's that?" I asked.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65607">"You're not together?" said the girl.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65610">"No, we just met," the cyclist and I confirmed.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65615">"Oh, you look like you're together. I mean, you're both wearing red rain jackets and you have red paniers."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65618">"You're wearing a red rain jacket too," I said. "You should join us."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65621">"I want to," She said. "I just woke up this morning and thought about doing a bike trip."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65624">The other cyclist left to keep riding, and me and the stranger crossed the street and went to sit on a picnic table in a park overlooking the coast.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65627">"I've been traveling for 9 months," said the stranger.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65630">"Why are you traveling?" I asked.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65633">"I just felt like I needed to. I need to figure out what I'm meant to do."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65636">"Me for the same reason." I told her.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65641">"Some people just seem to know what they're meant to do. Like I tell my sister about my existential crisis and all she says is 'I like my job and my boyfriend.'"</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65644">"Yeah, I have a lot of friends in Seattle who I think of as successful. They never seem to have any identity crisis. I don't know if it's a front, or if they're lying to themselves, or if they really have just found their calling. Meanwhile, I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes panicked that I won't leave my mark on the world."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65647">"What kind of mark do you want to leave?"</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65650">"I don't know. I think I would like to do something with technology....but sometimes I want to make films, sometimes I want to paint, sometimes I think I would just like to travel. Honestly, I have no idea."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65653">"I think sometimes we can make a mark just by being passionate about something."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65656">"Well, I'm very passionate, but I'm passionate about too many things."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65659">"I don't think you need to limit yourself.&nbsp;For instance, you could think of yourself as a person who creates things. Not just as a technologist or a filmmaker or a painter."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65662">"Mmmm," I said, staring at the ocean.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65667">"But how would I know? I'm just a closet philosopher," said the stranger, half-smiling.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65670">"So, are you cycling?" I wanted to know.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65673">"No, just sort of bouncing around from friend to friend. I've been here for the past month. One of my friends is letting me stay in his beach house."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65676">"That sounds cool. Are you planning to go somewhere specific?"</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65679">"No, I just wanted time to work on art and projects. I'm getting tired though. The thing is, when you're traveling, you don't ever have your own space. You're always invading someone else's space."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65682">"I know how that feels. I've been couchsurfing a bit, but mostly just camping. I was delayed and had to cancel two of my couchsurfs, and I felt like such a flake."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65685">"Yeah, I always feel like an imposition. I think I'm almost ready to be done traveling. But I'd really like to do a bike trip."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65688">"You should do one. This one has been really good, except for the rain." I told her about the lady in the store and the hair dryer.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65691">"That's what I love about bike trips," said the stranger. "You appreciate the little things."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65694">"Yes! Like a warm shower feels like the best thing ever."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65697">"Or a meal."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65700">"Oh my god, I know!&nbsp;All food tastes delicious! The trouble is, you get home and immediately return to your normal comfort level. It's the hedonic adaptation."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65703">"Yes, well that's what, you know, buddhism is for. You stay zen. You stay in the moment. You feel things as they happen. "</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65706">I stared out at the water, thinking. Then I got up to leave.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65709">The stranger held out her arms and I&nbsp;gave her a hug.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65712">"By the way, my name is Tara," she said.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65715">"Monica."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65720">I reached a town called "Gualala" by evening. Say it. "Gua-la-la."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65725">There was a little campsite in a state park, and I set up my tent before heading back to town to get food. The grocery store was already closed, so I went into the bar. I ordered a glass of wine and a salad. Wine hits you fast when you've just biked 120 miles. The other patrons in the bar were Mexican, and I found myself talking to them. The man next to me asked what I was drinking.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65730">"Es un Cabernet."</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65735">He sniffed it, and told the bartender to bring me something better. I protested. It was good enough.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_65740">"Solo lo mejor para ella." The bartender brought me a local (Sonoma) merlot. And another one. By the time the bar closed at midnight, I was dancing merengue furiously and teaching the other patrons Argentine swear words.&nbsp;The bartender turned on the closed sign and me and the Mexicans continued to dance merengue, bachata, and salsa, slipping and sliding on the bar floor, until at least 2am.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco - Last Day (Day 12)</title>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47132">On Saturday morning I made a bet with myself.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47135">I bet that I wouldn't get off my bicycle for 50 miles.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47140">Now, you might think that since I was doing 100 mile days this would be something that I did every day. But the reality was that it was an event when&nbsp;managed to keep pedaling&nbsp;for more than 20 miles. There was always something distracting. I had to get off my bike&nbsp;take a picture, or fill my water bottle, or fix my bike shorts wedgie. But today, I decided, would be different. Today I would actually stay on the bike.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47145">My first couple miles I decided didn't count. It's nice when you make bets against yourself because you can change the rules whenever you want. I had to pee, and I was dressed too warmly so I had to shed some layers. &nbsp;Once this was done, and I'd eaten some breakfast, my bet started.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47150">It was a beautiful day. Twenty miles whizzed by as I peddled along the coast. It was late morning by now, and there was a parade of cars coming toward me. Motorcyclists and convertibles were driving up from San Francisco's suburbs for a joyride on a sunny day.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47153">I was glad I was going the opposite direction.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47156">About 30 miles in I reached the climb. I congratulated myself. 30 miles without even putting one foot on the ground once. This had to be a record for me. The climb was up, up up white cliffs.</p><img src="http://www.henrymiller.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/big-sur.jpg" title="" alt=""/><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47162">There were cows on the road here. It was rather random - the cows seemed to have free range of the place. I came dangerously close to having to get off my bike a couple times, but thankfully the cows moved.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47167">The climb was unbelievable. 10 more miles of climb, and I felt like I was on top of the world. I couldn't believe that I still hadn't gotten off my bike.&nbsp;And then I stopped counting miles. I was having such a fun time that I didn't <em>want&nbsp;</em>to get off my bike.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47175">The downhill was fast. I don't think I have ever been more in the moment than I was on that downhill ride. There were grates in the road that I assume served as fences for the cows, because they were wide enough that a cow would get stuck in them. For me, they served as nerve racking, teeth-chattering obstacle courses, that took every inch of my balance and control to cross without being thrown head over heels. There were cars behind me when I started my descent. I worried that I might be getting in their way, since there was no shoulder . The roads wound back and forth in switchbacks making it impossible to pass safely. &nbsp;When I had a chance, I looked over my shoulder and&nbsp;realized that I had lost them.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47180">The wind blew my jacket out. It tickled my ears and fanned my sweaty hair under my helmet. I flew down towards the blue of the ocean. This is what it feels like to fly. This is what the Wright brothers dreamed of. Not some airless, soulless metal jumbo jet. They wanted to fly like birds. Like you fly on a bicycle going 50 miles per hour down an 8% grade.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47185">I wish I could say that my whole ride was like that, but Highway 1 took an abrupt left turn and headed inland after Bodega Bay. There were more climbs, and the sun was higher and hotter in the sky, and the wind was against me again. There was nothing but cow pasture. Cows, cows everywhere. I was sick of cows. Also, my water was gone, and it was beginning to look like there wouldn't be a town anytime soon. I had reached my 50 mile goal, and I was in the middle of nowhere. Since I didn't have anywhere to stop, I decided to extend my bet to 60 miles. I was beginning to get dizzy and think about stopping and laying down, when suddenly a tiny town appeared right at the 60 mile mark. I ate a sandwich at the town's deli. Then I went back to the counter and &nbsp;ordered a pastry. I sat inside next to a fan and leafed through a stray copy of "Vanity Fair." I didn't want to move. I didn't move for an hour. When I finally stood up around 3pm, I realized that I actually wasn't feeling so great anymore. But I decided to get back on the bike and see if I could do the remaining 55 miles to San Francisco in one more long, unstopping ride. I was counting mile posts once again, just trying to reach my destination.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47190">From the map, I had expected to arrive at Point Reyes soon and look out over the sea again. Instead, I kept riding past an ugly brown body of water called "Tomales Bay."&nbsp;I was trying to stay true to my bet though, so I didn't get off my bike and check my maps.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47195">After passing Tomales Bay, I got into another forest of scrubby trees that didn't seem like it would end. &nbsp;I knew I had to be near the water though. The cars passing me were all carrying surfboards.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47200">It was getting dark by the time I saw the sea again. &nbsp;I sped up as I approached Stinson Beach. Just after the beach was another insane climb. Frustrated, I broke my bet and got off my bike. I took a few photos, then got back on my bike. About a mile further, I felt like giving up. This climb was ridiculous and I was exhausted. I got off my bike again - this time to walk it up the hill. A young couple in a convertible passed me and asked if I was ok.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47205">"Yeah I'm fine," I told them. "I'm just done for the day." (I must have sounded crazy because I was still 10 miles from any civilization and I was pushing my bike up the middle of Highway 1 in the dark).</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47210">Look at the map above to get a feel for the elevation in Mt. Tomalpes State Park. This was after riding a bit over a century. Besides being tired, the other problem was that it was now completely dark and my front headlight was wearing out. It was too dim to help me see in front of me. The last descent into Marin City was even more "in the moment" than my descent earlier that afternoon had been.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47213">My hands hurt from gripping my handlebars. I found a gas station and sat on the cement curb. I was done. I called Tony to let him know that I had arrived. He had arrived in San Francisco earlier in the day, and apparently had been at a beer garden with friends since 2pm. They obviously weren't going to come pick me up.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47218">Maps told me that the only way way to San Francisco was to continue down Highway 1, which had turned into an 8 lane highway with no bike lane, or to head back into the State Park, travel another 10 miles and crest a couple more 3,000 ft peaks. I decided that Uber was the way to go.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47223">And so I ended up in San Francisco. My Uber driver, a young Russian, loaded my bike into her car. I told her my story and she made it clear that she wasn't impressed with Tony and his friends. "I can't believe they didn't come to meet you - and you after ride for 112 miles!"</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47228">But they were waiting for me when I arrived.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47233">Just writing this, 3 weeks later, makes me wish that I could go back to that last day on the coast, with the wind blowing in my hair. I felt alive for days after that, as Tony and I explored San Francisco on foot (we walked 14 miles on Sunday after partying all night) and as we returned by train to Seattle.</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1428729648703_47238">I also kept thinking about what the girl in the red raincoat, Tara, had said about living&nbsp;in the moment. &nbsp;But it wasn't just about living in the moment. That last day when I didn't let my feet touch the ground for 60 miles, and the day that I biked 176 miles, I realized that determination leads to happiness. The act of forcing yourself to do something difficult makes&nbsp;you to live your life with passion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://www.monicahouston.com/writing/85"><span><strong>January 30, 2pm:</strong></span></a></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Guess What! Hackster just bought a DeLorean!</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">What kind of DeLorean?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>:(I didn't know there were different kinds of Deloreans, so I quickly look this up)&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:13px">1981 DMC 12</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">A real one?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Yup. We’re going to drive it across the country to do hackathons!</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">Cool. I hope it runs well.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><strong>February 12, 12pm:</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Sooo... Where is the fuel cap on a Delorean? Please answer quickly. I am stuck at the gas station.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">well. mine has a little flap on the trunk lid(in front of the car) on the driver's side, but later on they removed that flap so you have to open the trunk to get to it now. There are a few maintenance items you will might need to get done. You should read this book.</span><a href="http://www.delorean.net/pdf/TIBGDA_web.pdf"><span style="font-size:13px"> </span><span style="font-size:13px">http://www.delorean.net/pdf/TIBGDA_web.pdf</span></a></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Uh... Reversing is also problematic...I was told to lift stick and pull back...But it's not working.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">I think I can help with that. I had to take mine apart for repairs and I made a video of the mechanism. It would help if you knew how it worked inside.</span><span> </span><span style="font-size:13px">I'll find the youtube video I pulled up to go in reverse one day and the shifter lever just broke off and I had to replace it with a part from a Lotus.</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTXwAL3Echs"><span> </span><span style="font-size:13px">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTXwAL3Echs</span></a></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Which direction do I pull back? I'm in a bit of a tight spot right now</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">Watch the video. I put it into reverse at about 0:45 in the video</span><span>.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">I also had problems getting into 2nd gear with mine and I had to have the linkage bushings all replaced and have everything re-adjusted by Toby at DMC Northwest. I think it was about $500 for the parts and labor. The parts are like $5. The labor is the expensive part. Those are NOT easy to get to. You pretty much HAVE to use a lift to get to them.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">Does that video help?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Thank you!!!</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Ok, so I have to open the trunk to get to the fuel - is there a lever inside somewhere?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">it's near the floor on the driver's side</span></span></p><p><span><a href="http://dmcnews.com/Techsection/pdfs/ownmanr1.pdf"><span style="font-size:13px">http://dmcnews.com/Techsection/pdfs/ownmanr1.pdf</span></a></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">oh.. and there is no power steering on these cars, so it's hard to get the wheel turned when you aren't moving very fast. I find that it helps to make sure your tires are properly inflated. The PSI values are printed on the inside of the glove box lid.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span style="font-size:13px">Did you find the trunk release?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">It's broken.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">oh no! ok.. try pulling up on the hood...er trunk... while you pull the release. The hinge is on the front of the car, it opens near the windshield so you should be able to pull on both at the same time.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Worked!</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">Sweet! It's a two person operation to get my engine cover open. Same problem. I keep a piece of wire in the car that I tie to the engine cover so I can pull up on it while I pull the release.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="font-size:13px"></span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span></span><span><span style="font-size:13px">Is the middle one fuel? It's very weird.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">Yeah. One of the other ones is for brake fluid I think. Did your gas cap have a lock on it? Probably not since you have to open your trunk to get to yours. I replaced my locking cap with a regular one.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">So you think the middle one in the picture is the one? I’m holding people up at the gas station here.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><strong>February 12, 2pm (a few frustrating hours later):</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span style="font-size:13px">: So, first day driving the car didn't last long...engine is having trouble and I would guess it is a fuel problem. I got it up to 60mph but it started 'bumping' and then despite giving it more gas, the RPMs started to decrease. May have to hit up DMC Northwest today...</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><strong>: </strong><span style="font-size:13px">Uh oh. Turn off your AC. Could be straining the motor</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: I</span><span style="font-size:13px"> didn't think it was on but I'll check.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Just turn the knob to off</span><span>. </span><span style="font-size:13px">How does the voltage gauge look?</span><span> </span><span style="font-size:13px">Should be about 13v when it's running.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">voltage gauge looks good.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Temp?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">temp is fine also</span><span>.</span><span style="font-size:13px"> So is oil. *<em>(I later learned that neither of these gauges was working)</em></span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Ok. Keep and eye on the temp gauge unless you know that all of the hoses have been replaced and your fan relays have been replaced.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Get a bottle of chevron techron from the parts store and dump it in your gas. Get the 12oz bottle. Fuel injectors could be dirty. That stuff will help clean them out.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">thanks! I'll let you know how that works.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">If you have a multimeter you could make sure you have the correct voltage to the coil. could also be a clogged fuel filter.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><strong>February 12, 4pm (even more frustrating hours later):</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Did your car make it?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">No, it's still stuck at a gas station near Lynwood</span><span> </span><span style="font-size:13px">I added the techron but since it was a full tank of gas I don't think it did anything</span><span>. </span><span style="font-size:13px">I let it run for a while anyway just for good measure and tried to drive it around the block, but ended up needing to push it back to a parking spot.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Oh no. so the engine keeps dying?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Yeah it sounds like either fuel or air.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Check the coil voltage. Someone on the forums said their car started loosing power and then wouldn't stay running after they started it and it was because of the coil.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Mmm interesting</span><span>. Will do.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Oh..and I just emailed you PDFs of the wiring diagrams for the car.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>February 17, 4pm:</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Did your DeLorean make it to DMC NW safely?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">yup it's having the fuel system fixed</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">What was broken?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">fuel pressures were off because gas tank had leaks</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Oh no!</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">fuel filter was also plugged up</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">So I guessed right on the fuel filter</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">and pump wasn't working well, which is what I could hear when I ran the car</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>February 21, 4pm (The weekend of our first hackathon):</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Hey, does your delorean come with a spare tire?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Yes. I think it's in the trunk under the mat</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Ours didn't come with one apparently. We're going to need a new wheel and tire</span><span>. </span><span style="font-size:13px">Any chance we could borrow your spare just to get it to the building</span><span>. </span><span style="font-size:13px">It's in my garage 10 blocks from the hackathon.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Any idea if a normal spare world fit on a Delorean? Can't reach Toby at DMC Northwest.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">I have no idea. Check the dmctalk message board. Maybe someone nearby has a wheel they can loan you.</span></span></p>

I broke down on the way to Portland. The car is leaking gasoline.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Where did you break down? Where is the gas leaking from?</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">I'm in Factoria. The gas is leaking from both the engine and the gas tank.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">both? That's weird. must be high pressure or something Get it over to Toby at least you aren't far away</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">Yeah tow truck should be here in 5</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">ask him to check out everything let him know you plan to take it on long road trips. ask him about the tires and the hoses. and the trailing arm bolts (the original parts were made of inferior materials) They attach the rear wheels to the frame of the car.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>Monica Simone Houston</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">I will ask all of that</span><span>. </span><span style="font-size:13px">Thank you!</span><span> </span><span style="font-size:13px">I really hope this works, but I think we will now have to tow the car between cities.</span></span></p><p><span><strong>DeLorean Friend</strong><span>: </span><span style="font-size:13px">I would suggest towing it anyways.</span></span></p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>I get the whole deLorean thing.. 88mph! But don't you also think it's even cooler to be driving something extremely fuel efficient? When I think of a Hackster mobile, I think of a car that might run on little gas and perhaps something innovative like air, hydrogen, solar, etc.. </p>

<p>Now I'm thankful I never got one of those cars! Looks cool but is clearly a nightmare..</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Monica - That particular DeLorean suffers mostly from &quot;sins of the previous owner&quot;.  Once we get the car back to a stable and mostly stock configuration, your DeLorean experience should be much smoother.  My DeLorean is pressing 200K miles pretty hard, and is doing great.  Always feel free to contact me at DMCNW or any of your other DeLorean friends for any questions that come up.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>Productivity is a Trap - My TheListserve Email</title>
      <link>/writing/thelistserve</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>On June 1st, I got an email telling me that I'd won <a href="http://thelistserve.com/">the listserve</a>. This is what I wrote. In a future blog posts, I hope to share some of the great advice and comments I received.</em></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I wake up at 7am because I’m so excited about working on the app that I had started writing the night before and I want to get a few hours of work in before my "real" work. I click the</span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/strict-workflow/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd?hl=en"><span style="font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-size:15px">pomodoro timer</span></a><span style="font-size:15px"> in the upper left hand corner of Google Chrome to start the 25 minute count down. While it’s running, the pomodoro app blocks gmail, facebook and youtube. Ingenious, right? I love productivity apps.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">In fact, I love productivity tricks so much that my friends ask me for productivity advice.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">There’s a new productivity app that uses binaural beats that I signed up for...what was it called? I don’t remember, so I open my email. The timer is running so I can’t open gmail because it's blocked. No worries - I simply switch to incognito window in chrome and open gmail there. I search for the activation notice in my email. Ah, it was called</span><a href="https://www.focusatwill.com/"><span style="font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-size:15px">Focus@will</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I open it up and try to start the music. It doesn’t work. I try different browsers and different buttons for about ten minutes before filing a support ticket.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Now that I’m not being blocked by my pomodoro extension, I decide to check facebook. Staring me in the face is an opinion piece on the New York Times about why women wear heals. Ok, I’ll take that bait. I read it. Then I see a link to another article in Fashion and Style that sounds interesting, so I start reading without finishing the first article.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">The timer rings, reminding me of why I’m working already at 7:30am. I just wasted an entire pomodoro doing things besides writing that app. Facepalm.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I have trouble finishing things.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Two years ago, I made a</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOohAkgnxie7ZtqwZCnyW-zwTRNqpmw4SKUJr1_7xhg/pub"><span style="font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-size:15px">list of my unfinished projects</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">. I hoped that seeing what I hadn’t finished would give me the kick in the pants that I needed to be more productive. The final list had over 100 projects on it. Rather than help me, reviewing this list discouraged me.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Why did I start projects at all if I wasn’t going to finish them? Why wake up early, miss out on sleep, give up relationships, and then fail to finish?</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I feel like I’ve been stuck in an uncreative slump ever since. I don’t want to start something that I won’t finish, so I don’t start it at all. This has been good for my relationships, and maybe even my job, but I feel like part of me is missing. As I keep rejecting the ideas as they pop into my head, they stop coming.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">The funny thing is that reading over the list of unfinished projects, I did eventually finish most of them. It just took me longer than it might have taken someone else. I finished the relevant parts of the Design Patterns book. I learned to play poker. I went through all of</span><a href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/"><span style="font-size:15px"> </span><span style="font-size:15px">Lady Ada's tutorials</span></a><span style="font-size:15px">. &nbsp;</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">It’s not that I don’t finish things, it’s that I finish them on my own timeline. I know that if I start washing the dishes this morning, I’ll finish them by tomorrow night (which is frustrating for my boyfriend). I wish that I wasn’t like this. I wish that I had better self-control and finished projects in four hours instead of four months. But according to modern science, ADHD cannot be cured. So for now, I’ll keep using my productivity apps to help me. Also, I’ll start lots of things and eventually I’ll finish them.</span></span></p><p> </p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">See, I finished this email :)</span></span></p><p><br /><br /><br /> </p>]]></content:encoded>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>&quot;During the year 1957, I experienced, by the grace of God, a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and  privilege to make others happy through music. I feel this has been granted through His grace. All praise to God...<br />   This album is a humble offering to Him. An attempt to say &quot;Thank you God&quot; through our work, even as we do in our hearts and with our tongues. May He help and strengthen all men in every good endeavor.&quot;<br />- John Coltrane, excerpt, liner notes to A Love Supreme</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>Salut de la France. First ListServe post I ever replied to. Couldn't resist this time, since I recognize myself for 100% in it. I even wrote my own Pomodoro timer, that I never use. As for the four-hour projects that turn out to take four months, full ack, and add a couple of years to it.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

      <title>The Best of The Listserve's Productivity Advice</title>
      <link>/writing/thelistserve2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>On May 1st I was given the opportunity to write about myself to 25,000 people on <a href="http://thelistserve.com/">The Listserve</a>. &nbsp;I chose to write about <a href="http://www.monicahouston.com/writing/thelistserve">my struggle finishing things</a>, and the responses have been amazing. Here are some of the best.</em></p><hr /><p><strong>From a guy in NYC:</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">You have a very defeatist and victim mindset</span></span><span><span style="font-size:13px">...Listen on Audible to autobiographies from people like Arnold Schwartzennegar, Ted Turner, and T. Boone Pickens for inspiration.</span></span></p><p><em><span style="font-size:13px">-Oh wait. I said I was going to include the best advice. How did this nugget&nbsp;get in the mix?&nbsp;</span></em></p><hr /><p><strong>Simple, Beautiful Advice:</strong></p><p>- Do fewer things simultaneously. Simply. Just pick one project you love and focus on that every day, if only for a few minutes. Keep a journal/notes on ideas you're "rejecting" - because you're not rejecting them, you're just not doing them right now.</p><p>- Stop looking at how much others are doing (which probably isn't accurate anyway) and just focus on yourself, being the smallest bit better every day. Might be that you worked a bit longer, or that you didn't have to struggle as much with something or whatever. Celebrate that.</p><p>- Not to get too crunchy on you, but there's a quote I ran across from the bhagavad gita that I really love to turn over in my mind. It's basically <strong>"You're not entitled to the fruits of your labor, you're only entitled to the labor itself."</strong> &nbsp;Not sure why that resonates so much with me, but it reminds me to concentrate on what I'm doing that day rather than what I think the outcome could or should be.</p><p>I'll also recommend reading the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (but you have to get the Gregory Hays translation). There's a lot of timeless wisdom in there, and the Hays translation is very modern.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>"Tax" Time-wasting activities:</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Write&nbsp;down precisely when you&nbsp;start&nbsp;and when you&nbsp;finish distractions. </span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Before going to Facebook, before checking emails, or before attempting any activities that does not further the project,&nbsp;write down the current time in a (physical) notebook first. Go through with the distraction. And upon finishing the distraction, write the current time down. </span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Finishing things is a muscle that needs to be exercised.</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">I think you may have nailed an interesting point without realizing it: you finished this email. That's a thing. That counts. An email to 25,000 people no less! But an email is small -- maybe build on that? Pick small things that you feel confident that you can finish. A wise fellow once told me that finishing things is, in itself, a skill, so consider finishing lots of small things in order to build that muscle so it take on bigger, more ambitious projects.</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>From a fellow distracted person:</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">I downloaded some software called&nbsp;</span><a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/">self-control</a><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;when I was writing my dissertation. It doesn't let you away with the incognito mode trick! Maybe it will help.</span></p><hr /><p><strong>Maybe you're getting bored because you already understand the problem.</strong></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">I have also started lot of projects because they give me the chance to learn or figure out something new, and as soon as I think I understand the problem and know what the solution is, it is not that interesting to implement the solution and finish the project (although no project is ever finished, there is always more or better you can do with it, right?).</span></p><hr /><p><strong>Listening Recommendations:</strong></p><p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

It's definitely on my list now.</em></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Advice for the unproductive programmer:</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">- Pick a project. Any project. Work on it until it's finished, no exceptions. Turn off Netflix, turn on your productivity apps. Finish the project, no matter how minor it is, or how little you care to actually finish it. <strong>The sense of accomplishment you get from finishing a single project can drive you to complete a handful of others. </strong>"Opportunities multiply as they are seized"...</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">- If you have people you spend time with, it can be extremely detrimental to your projects if they are interrupting your coding flow with normal human things. One of the best ways I have been able to help my friends and family understand what we do is to explain to them how much programming is like dreaming. There's a rather famous essay out there called "<a href="http://alexthunder.livejournal.com/309815.html"><strong>Don't wake the programmer</strong></a>", and it will help the people around you to minimize disturbing your flow.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">- Speaking of flow, Facebook and the like is my greatest enemy when it comes to flow. It's just muscle memory to alt-tab and F5 Facebook every couple of minutes. This effectively nullifies any flow, or progress towards flow. Still to this day I have to actively work to build up to flow. <strong>Headphones are your best bet </strong>wherever you code, since there are ways around the productivity-killers (as you mention).</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">- Every programmer is always fighting<strong> yak shaving</strong>. Even the most productive programmers spend hours reading the install instructions of some library and fighting their OS and tools. I frequently had anxiety brought on by yak shaving. I always thought to myself how awful it is that other programmers are just banging out code and here I am totally blowing an afternoon on tooling. But the anxiety went away and my life got better when I finally talked to enough of our peers and understood that every one of us shaves yaks for more time than we code.</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Shock Yourself.</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">I was just reading about this productivity tool that electrically shocks you before I got your listserve. A bit more medieval but I wonder how effective it'd be: </span><a href="http://pavlok.com/"><span style="font-size:13px">http://pavlok.com/</span></a></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Documentation is Key.</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">It’s a good habit to document ideas, actions and results since it does give a sense of achievement in the long run. It also provides a larger picture a year down the line. Its annoying cause I always thought I could do without spending time on such documentation but that strategy is clearly failing. So for now, I try my best to write it down so that I can at least revisit and complete it when I am lacking ideas.</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Find your productive&nbsp;time of day and break that time into manageable chunks.</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">For me, finding the time of day that I actually find myself productive (regardless of when I </span><em>want</em><span style="font-size:13px"> to be) has been helpful. For some reason when I get up early and there's no prepping for something (i.e. showering for work, eating breakfast, etc.), I get stuff done. It's the preparing process that I take my time with and enjoy so much (I will spend a whole Saturday cleaning my apartment) that it ends up taking over the task I'm prepping for. A 4:30 wake-up kills this. I am too early to be hungry, I don't need coffee, it's still dark in my apartment and most importantly it's quiet. Somehow the internet isn't calling to me just yet.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">I also limit myself to little ten minute stretches of time where I'll get things done. 10 minutes to pick up my living room, 10 minutes to do dishes, that sort of thing. I find that it's just enough time to get something done and just little enough time that I don't mentally allow myself to get distracted.</span></span></p><hr /><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">I read somewhere that the average person</span><strong> greatly overestimates how much they can get done in a day, but grossly underestimates how much they can get done in a year</strong><span style="font-size:13px">.</span><strong> </strong><span style="font-size:13px">I take great solace and comfort in that thought. But then the years pass.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">We're very hard on ourselves. But it's hard not to be when we know that we're filled with so much potential. All of us are. But some of us know it more than others. And that in itself can be maddening.</span></span></p><hr /><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">I recently finished my doctorate thesis and it took me longer than others on my course. I finally got it done in the end, but it nearly killed my spirit. I wouldn't have finished it only for the fact that doing it allows me to practice as a clinical psychologist, something that I do enjoy. But I'm not sure I would do it again if I could go back and choose.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">So if you feel pressured to finish a project you started, also remember that you don't have to, <strong>your happiness and health is more important</strong>!</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Be Methodical.</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Do a 1-pager every morning with an actual pen and paper, first thing, before you even open your computer. Write down:</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">The top 3-5 things you want done today</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Then, within those things, each task that needs to be done in order to finish that thing.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Then, you write a list of people that you might be waiting on in order to complete a task</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Then a list of people you need to contact to complete a task.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Final step: go into your calendar and input every single task that you're going to do based on that list.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Notice you only go into your email to either search for an email you were waiting for, or write one. There is no "checking email" slot that goes on for hours.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">EG:</span></span></p><ol dir="ltr"><li><span><span style="font-size:13px">7:30-7:35 email Steve re: UI bugs</span></span></li><li><span><span style="font-size:13px">7:35-7:40 email Karen re: legal question</span></span></li><li><span><span style="font-size:13px">7:40-8:40 draft copy for homepage</span></span></li><li><span><span style="font-size:13px">8:40-8:45 break</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Etc with reminders at the time and 1 minute before.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">For some reason, just having even the simplest of tasks in there with reminders, means you see it flash up and you just DO it. There is no decision to be made of "shall I send that email or write that copy or read that article?"</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">It's already decided and so you expend zero mental energy and willpower choosing between what to do next.</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Trauma and Adrenaline are ADHD Killers.</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">So I guess my advice would be to take at least a few months and go somewhere actually terrible things are happening in the world, and experience the struggle to improve some of the most basic things in life for people who don't have everything like we do in America. Longer would probably be better, but I know most people aren't willing to sign on for 4 years like I was (3.5 years ago, now. As someone leaving the military, i can't recommend it as an option for this sort of personal journey. Most members of the military that i know don't treat it this way- it's just a job.).</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">It's definitely not the sort of ADD or ADHD hack you read about on lifehacker. But it's certainly done wonders for me. I'm sure there are other ways to address the problem, but it is a fact that historically there are few cultures which have exhibited anything resembling what we call attention deficit disorders, and they are characterized by a constant detachment from the sorts of traumatic experiences that are very stressful, but perhaps necessary for balanced attention.</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Don't Work.</strong><br /><span><span style="font-size:13px">"Work is the source of nearly all the misery in the world...."</span><a href="http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html"><span style="font-size:13px">http://www.zpub.com/notes/black-work.html</span></a></span></p><hr /><p><strong>Focus on Friendship, Not Productivity</strong></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">After almost ten years working for nonprofits I can tell you that work, regardless of how many you help, will never be as important as the ones you love. It's also true you should work at your friendships. And no, networking event participation does not count.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Friendship is more than bringing a case of beer to the barbecue or standing as a Godparent and failing miserably to even attempt to fill the role.&nbsp;It's being present and contributing to your peoples lives. It's not just making them laugh but also making sure they know you will be there to make them smile when they're too weak to laugh. It's holding their hand through the divorce and helping them get back into the dating pool when they're ready.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">If people only wanna hang but completely disappear when sh*t hits the fan and you consider them a friend. You are selling yourself short. Lower the emotional investment you are making into that person and fill that space doing something for a friend that showed up for you.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:13px">Some people are meant to be associates and that's fine too. Invite them to the parties and barbecues and have drinks with them on their birthday and have great evening dinners together. But stop expecting more from people than they are willing to give. It's such a waste of time. And for the people who show up, do something BIG. They have earned it after all.</span></span></p><p><br /><span><span style="font-size:13px">Since I've been out of the country for the past few years I have plans to execute my own personal friend appreciation week this Summer where I will dedicate myself to my friends for a full week, helping them out, sharing my big projects with them and overall showing that now that i'm back in town physically that I am back all those other ways friends are too. The vulnerability makes me anxious, but, hey, that's what drives me.</span></span></p><hr /><p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">Thought from and old person</span></strong></p><p><span style="font-size:16px">maybe you could just get comfortable with being an "idea person" ?- we need as many of those in the world, as the people that take them forward - productivity is way over-rated - especially when most worthwhile endings in life are really about the journey</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>You've Come a Long Way, Baby</title>
      <link>/writing/273</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brain isn't fully developed until around age 25.* Various factors, such as trauma, parental styles, and having dumb friends can delay or stall brain development, so some brains aren't fully developed until later, or may never fully develop.
While visiting for the holidays I told my parents that I now have an adult brain. They thought that I said that I have an addled brain.</p>
<p>In spite of their opinion I believe that my brain has improved significantly over the past two years.  Reading over my blog I can definitely see this.
In fact, I'm surprised that my adult friends have put up with me for this long. Even comments that I made a month ago on twitter make me do a facepalm.</p>
<p>One thing that seems strange is that we are sent to college before we can truly take advantage of the learning opportunities there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*You can see the development in the young adult brain at MIT's site here: http://hrweb.mit.edu/worklife/youngadult/</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Does This Keep Anyone Else Up at Night?</title>
      <link>/writing/275</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where do thoughts come from? I am having too many tonight. I wanted to roll over, forget them and fall asleep. Thoughts die all the time. But I imagined infinite space and infinite time devouring my thoughts and not even leaving the bones. It felt uncomfortable, like I had to do something about it - like I had to fight back.
I've been thinking too much about Time recently. Am I wasting my time?</p>
<p>Today as I was brushing my teeth, I thought about how we humans can do anything we put our minds to.</p>
<p>The problem is that we can't put our minds to anything.</p>
<p>What are the things we can't imagine?</p>
<p>I wish I knew everything, and at the same time I'm glad I don't know everything. I will never know everything, although I will know more than I know now. <em>We</em> will never know everything.</p>
<p>What is the point of knowing anything?</p>
<p>Does this keep anybody else up at night? Or am I just going through existential puberty later than everyone else? Or maybe I'm having my midlife crisis early. I did start on the existential questions very early - I remember clearly sitting on the back stoop at age 4, wondering why I was me and what it would be like to not be me.</p>

      <title>Seattle to San Francisco  Day 4</title>
      <link>/writing/312</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday night I dreamed that I was stealing peanut butter and jelly sandwiches from children’s lunchboxes and eating them. I was happy to find peanut butter and jelly and artisan bread in the hostel kitchen. I helped myself to it liberally, before heading to Ray’s coffee shop for a soy latte.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ray and I charted a course. He told me that the best way to get out of town would be to take Cornell Road to the 26, the 26 to State Route 6, and then State Route 6 to the Tillamook, and then to Lincoln City if I made it that far, which was unlikely given that it was almost noon and I hadn’t started. He told me that once had ridden to Tillamook and back in one day. It was one of the happiest days of his life, he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back at the hostel there was a package waiting for me at the front desk containing my phone and passport. It was pouring rain and windy, and I had to pack and repack my bags to get my rain gear out. It was hard to leave the warm dry hostel and the other young people who were gathered at tables in the common area, chatting and playing board games.</p>
<p>Leaving civilization is always difficult. It is never a desire, it is a compulsion. This, I realize, is why I had drawn the comparison between myself and El Cid. Whether you are compelled by something internal or external, leaving is always against your instinct to stay. Humans find safety in numbers. We find comfort in company. To leave the herd, you must fight this instinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was thinking these thoughts as I pushed myself out of the Willamette Valley on a bicycle and headed south. I came to the 26. It was a busy highway with a narrow margin for bikers. The rain was pouring by now though, and visibility was poor. I decided to attempt another route. I didn’t want to take my phone out of my bag in the pouring rain, so I decided to just try riding West. I set off. Riding without thinking of where I was going or how fast I was going gave my mind time to meditate. I thought about the past few days, and my time in Portland. I thought about my time cycling in France. I had had one day of rain the entire trip, and I had forgotten about it. I was leaving Arles, I think, and the rain was cold and wet, as April rain tends to be. I didn’t have far to go. I was staying in a town called Jonquieres, I think. But riding in the rain again, I remembered the misery of that ride, and how alone I had felt. Interesting how I had completely forgotten that day. I wondered if I would forget this day also, or if I would turn the memory of my soaked socks and sneakers and the way my raincoat soaked through and stuck to my bare skin into a happy memory of an adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it was a happy memory. When the rain let up, I felt myself flying on two wheels through Suburban Oregon. And more suburban Oregon. And more suburban Oregon. And it started to rain again, and the sun got lower in the sky. And I passed under I5. But I was too lost in thought to notice. Until I got to the 26 again. This time I pulled my phone out of my bag and turned it on. I almost cried. I was past Beaverton, headed back into Portland. Instead of crying, I laughed. I had been riding in a circle all afternoon. I had to make a decision – whether to head back to Portland or turn around and continue heading to Tillamook. It was an easy decision. It was getting darker and rainier, I was soaked and shivering, and I knew there was a warm hostel bed waiting for me in Portland. I crossed over the 26<sup>th</sup> and climbed for a ways before heading towards the arboretum and zipping down curving, narrow roads through beautiful homes going faster than the speed limit. I returned to the hostel and walked in, dripping and covered in mud and gravel. They were full, they said, but I could call the hostel downtown. They were full too. I tried calling my friend Zach, but he was trecking in Nepal. So I called Ray and asked for yet another favour. “Maybe you know someone who could host a cyclist for a night?”</p>
<p>He said he would try to find me a place, and invited me over until then. It was nice to be somewhere warm. I sat in one of his chairs and soaked through the cushions. He laughed it off. He let me use his shower and it was the best shower I have ever taken. None of his friends had space. “Do you mind if I crash on your floor?” I asked. He didn’t. Well that was easy. We planned my route for the next day. I had to be in Florence, where my next couchsurfing host lived. I could either do 169 miles going west out of the valley and then south, or I could do 176 miles going south through Oregon City and then west. Going South first had fewer hills, and since I was carrying 40 odd pounds of gear and water it made more sense. I was nervous. Cycling 175 miles in a day is not a small deal for me. Neither of us could sleep, so we ended up talking most of the night like two giddy highschool girls at a sleepover.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Northwest Stereotypes</title>
      <link>/writing/45</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I've been on the West Coast a total of ten days, and my impressions probably aren't worth much and will certainly change. But for what they're worth, here they are:
<strong>People are polite.</strong> When I first arrived, I couldn't help noticing that people in the airport were more polite. Unlike Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, or, god help us, Newark airports, people didn't push and shove to get on the ground transportation. There were no crazy people yelling at the concierges because they had missed their flights. Everybody seemed rational and orderly. I credit this to better, more modern infrastructure. Unlike the Newark airport, where an entire planeload of people had to crowd into one tiny elevator to get up to the terminal, the Seattle airport had a reliable system that people obviously trusted. Also, people just seem to be more relaxed in general. Maybe because</p>
<p><strong>People are really in to Yoga/Tai Chi/Veganism. </strong>Ok, that's a bit of a generalization, but then again so is this entire post. It seems like there is a yoga place on every street corner, and many restaurants are either vegan or vegetarian. I wish that I had lived here when I was a geeky high schooler experimenting with raw foods - maybe I wouldn't have caved to the social pressures and quit. Here there don't seem to be too many social pressures, probably since</p>
<p><strong>Everyone is a little weird. </strong>What is it with blue hair in Seattle? There is definitely a stereotype of the grungy hipster Seattleite, but it seems that there are also plenty of "normal," corporate type people who work at Microsoft and Boeing and just practice a little healthy weirdness on the side, in the form of barefoot running, biking everywhere, or being an obsessive compulsive recycler. Again, why didn't I live here in high school?</p>

      <title>Buying a Boat</title>
      <link>/writing/93</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Buying a boat is a lot more complicated than buying a bike is. Soon, my bike will no longer be my most expensive vehicle (sorry bike. you've been outclassed).
<ol>
<li>The first thing to do, even before shopping for a boat, is to qualify for a boat loan. This will give you extra leverage and make sellers take you seriously. Even if you're like me and you still get asked what grade you're in. There are a lot of loans available for boats that cost more than $25,000 and are newer than 30 years. Otherwise, your best bet will be to get a loan from a small local bank. Dress up professionally when visiting the bank and pretend that you've done this before.</li>
<li>You now must make an offer and put a deposit down. This is where your boat surveyor comes in handy. She can tell you what the boat is worth, and a reasonable offer. It's probable that the seller knows what the boat is worth also, so don't embarrass yourself by offering something too much lower. If you decided not to buy the boat because it doesn't pass survey, your deposit should be refunded. You should always sign one of these: http://www.oceanmarinellc.com/brokerage/PurchaseandSaleAgreement.pdf</li>

      <title>The Long and Winding Road to Being More Productive</title>
      <link>/writing/post_id-4</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I wake up at 7am because I’m so excited about finishing the app that I had started writing the night before. I click the pomodoro timer in the upper left hand corner of Google Chrome to start the 25 minute count down. While it’s running, the pomodoro app&nbsp;blocks email, facebook and youtube. Ingenious, right? I love productivity apps.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Then I remember that productivity app with the binaural beats that I just got a free trial for...what was it called? I don’t remember, so I open my email. The timer is running so I can’t open gmail because it's blocked. No worries - I simply ‘switch person’ in chrome and open gmail there. I search for the activation notice in my email. Ah, it was called Focus@will. </span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I open it up and try to start the music. It doesn’t work. I try different browsers and different buttons for about five minutes before filing a support ticket.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Now that my other browser is open anyway, I decide to check facebook. Staring me in the face is an opinion piece on the New York Times about why women wear heals. Ok, I’ll take that bait. I read it. Then I see a link to an article in Fashion and Style, which reminds me that I haven’t read Modern Love in several weeks. Without even finishing the article about women in heels, I switch to Modern Love.</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">The timer rings, reminding me of why I’m working already at 7:30am. I just wasted an entire pomodoro doing things besides writing that app. Facepalm.&nbsp;</span></span></p><hr /><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I have trouble finishing things.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Two years ago, I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOohAkgnxie7ZtqwZCnyW-zwTRNqpmw4SKUJr1_7xhg/pub">list of my unfinished projects</a>. I hoped that seeing what I hadn’t finished would give me the kick in the pants that I needed to be more productive. The final list had over 100 projects on it. Rather than help me, reviewing this list discouraged me. </span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Why did I start projects at all if I wasn’t going to finish them? Why wake up early, miss out on sleep, give up relationships, and then fail to finish? And why start new projects while I still hadn't finished old ones?</span></span><span><span style="font-size:15px">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I stopped blogging,&nbsp;contributing to open source projects and creating new arduino projects. I also started dating someone who woke up early and went to bed early, so I changed my sleeping patterns and stopped doing all nighters and hanging out at makerspaces committing code and watching tutorials until 4am. </span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">I stopped focusing on tech and I started focusing on people. </span></span><span style="font-size:15px">I stopped attending tech meetups and hackathons, and I started organizing them.</span>&nbsp;I made a lot of friends. I achieved more happiness, and I learned a lot about myself. But I still felt like something was missing. I missed the rush of having an idea and making it come to life on my own. I felt like a cheap hack for organizing events about making while I barely made anything myself.</p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">The funny thing is that reading over the list of projects, I did eventually&nbsp;finish most of them. It just took me longer than my idealistic expectations could handle. Going through the list now, I realize that there are at least 10 more I could check off. I finished Shayne's Design Patterns book. I learned to play poker. I went through all of Lady Ada's tutorials. &nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Almost every day I still have moments like the one I described at the beginning of this post. I wish that I didn't. I wish that I had better self-control and finished projects in four&nbsp;hours instead of four months. But I'm also no longer ashamed of taking four months to finish something. Maybe it's&nbsp;because I'm 26 and my chances of ever being a prodigy are now gone, so there's no hurry.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Maybe it's because I finally feel like I've had some success with interpersonal relationships, and I realize that friendship is about&nbsp;being myself - not proving myself (I feel like there's another blog post in here somewhere).&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span style="font-size:15px">Or maybe, just maybe,&nbsp;it's because I've discovered an amazing new productivity app that I think will finally work to help me finish projects. Which is why next time I'm going to write about my experiences with the amazing app, HabitRPG.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>How to Be an Adult Contest</p></blockquote>
<p>So, after writing about how to be an adult I want to hear from my readers. What do you think it means to be an adult?</p>
<p>Submit your essays, short fiction, poetry, or lists that are 500 words or less on the topic "How to Be an Adult" by June 21st.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from readers of all ages. The winners will be announced on June 30th. First, second, and third place will have their writing published on my blog.  First place winner will get an original artwork, Second place winner will get an original signed comic, and Third place winner will get a worthless doodle or something. Because third place really isn't a winner. But good luck! I hope to hear from you soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>
