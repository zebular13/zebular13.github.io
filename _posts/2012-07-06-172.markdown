So that's it! I have my very own boat. I'll give more details in a bit. First things first though, I need a good name for her. And not just any name. I've decided that I want the name to be a computer science pun. For instance, a friend suggested "Sea++", "Sea#", or "C Shell." The dinghy also needs a name (preferably something that matches).
To up the stakes, the person who thinks of the best name for the sailboat or the dinghy gets to christen them at the boat christening party on August 4th.




To help you out, the boat is a 1974 29' Ericson with light blue trim and green sail covers. The sails are white and the spinnaker is blue and yellow.
