So, after writing about how to be an adult I want to hear from my readers. What do you think it means to be an adult?
Submit your essays, short fiction, poetry, or lists that are 500 words or lessÂ on the topic "How to Be an Adult" by June 21st.




I would love to hear from readers of all ages. The winners will be announced on June 30th. First, second, and third place will have their writing published on my blog.




Submit your original pieces to **_monica [at] houstonfamily [dot] info._**




First place winner will get an original artwork, Second place winner will get an original signed comic, and Third place winner will get a worthless doodle or something. Because third place really isn't a winner. But good luck! I hope to hear from you soon!
