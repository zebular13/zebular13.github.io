I have always had dull looking hair. I thought that by not doing damaging things, like blowdrying and curling my hair, and by eating a healthy diet, it would magically become shiny. Then I realized that shiny hair comes from using a straightener.
My skin was terrible most of my life. It improved at the same time as my stress levels decreased (through starting a new job and doing hypnotherapy) and my diet improved (I started supplementing with standard process supplements and did a cleanse recommended by my nutritionist).
Still, my hair and skin aren't great.
I've noticed my skin seems dryer recently - probably partially as a result of the ADD meds that dehydrate me. I just got a new IUD so my hormones have been wack recently, and I've had some acne on my chin that is driving me nuts. 

You know when you meet someone whose hair and skin glows? I want to be one of those people. I'm pretty suspicious of most skincare products. Really expensive stuff I've bought from L'Oreal and other mainstream skincare lines have made my skin worse or made no difference. 

Exfoliating with an electric brush seemed to improve my skin somewhaT. Supplements, diet and hormones make the biggest change. When I took birth control to control cramps in high school and college I got TERRIBLE cramps. Sauna also seems to help my skin. 

Here's some things that people recommend:
Castor oil. 
Apparently it's a very old remedy for hair growth. The Amazon reviews are certainly positive.
Coconut oil. 
Goat's milk. 

Do you know someone who glows? What are their secrets?
