Monica Houston lives in Seattle, Washington, on a sailboat named the "Infinite Sloop." Although she holds degrees in Film, French, and International Studies, she developed an affinity for code at the age of 18 while working with Action Script at Penn State's Applied Research Labs.

Monica is an avid maker and tinkerer, and she founded and runs the Seattle Arduino Meetup. As a Startup Weekend Organizer, she organized the first Startup Weekend focusing on hardware in 2013. Since then, she has organized almost a dozen hackathons, and is currently in charge of organizing Hackster.io's #hardwareweekend hackathon series.
